> Any pages within the Archive section have been retained for legacy purposes only.

1. Overview 

Navigate here for table-level resources on being a player in this game or for tracking notable changes to the documentation.

2. Rules Reference 

Adventuring in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] alternates between three core modes of play: [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]], and [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]]. Each mode represents different kinds of situations with different time scales, and characters can use different sorts of actions and activities in each. In addition, there are a number of [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Subsystems\|Subsystems]], which are situational gameplay modes that can help provide structure to common-but-complicated activities. While [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/) remains the primary resource for rules for this game, this section houses information on any rules that are useful to be able to link to within the wiki, as well as any rules variants and house rules we will be using for this game. 

3. Campaign Journal 

The most interesting parts of our world are the stories you will create in it! The chronicles of your adventures will be catalogued here. 

4. Gazetteer 

The primary guidebook to the locations, landmarks, and geographical features of our setting. 

5. Dramatis Personae 

The primary guidebook to the most important characters of this setting. Find information related to notable [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Factions\|Factions]] here. 

6. Common Knowledge 

The information in this section represents common knowledge and experiences of an average person in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. Some of these details are things that may require [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|recalling knowledge]] or might be more familiar to those with specialized experience or relevant backgrounds, but generally do not require higher education or extensive training. 

7. Scholarly Details 

While all the information found in [[6. Common Knowledge/6. Common Knowledge\|Common Knowledge]] is likely to be a part of normal life for an average citizen, these topics are subjects that typically require an educated mind and/or specific training. Players are free to browse this section at their leisure, but your characters must have an appropriate background and/or make meaningful efforts in-game (such as talking to NPCs, [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Research/Research\|researching]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|recalling knowledge]], or [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|gathering information]]) to gain full access to this knowledge.
