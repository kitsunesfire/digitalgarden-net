Welcome to the private Obsidian wiki for Sharum Mal'Kari, a custom setting for PF2e. 

**DISCLAIMER**: This content is for private tabletop use only, and not intended for monetary gain. Many of the concepts, themes, items, and titles within are uniquely connected but not wholly original, and I take no personal credit for any of the included artwork. 

If this is your first time visiting, please take a moment to review the [[1. Overview/Using This Wiki\|Using This Wiki]] page. If you've been here before, I encourage you to reference the [[1. Overview/Change Log\|Change Log]] for any significant alterations since your last visit. 

I'm looking forward to telling many great stories together!

## Navigation

>[!recite|c-red] Archive

Any pages within the Archive section have been retained for legacy purposes only. As they are not actively maintained, they are not necessarily accurate or up to date, and often contain contradictory information to what is presented elsewhere in this guide. **Please do not rely on these pages as a resource for the current campaign**. 

>[!recite|c-black] Overview

Navigate here for table-level resources on being a player in this game or for tracking notable changes to the documentation.

>[!recite|c-orange] Rules Reference

Adventuring in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] alternates between three core modes of play: [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]], and [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]]. Each mode represents different kinds of situations with different time scales, and characters can use different sorts of actions and activities in each. In addition, there are a number of [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Subsystems\|Subsystems]], which are situational gameplay modes that can help provide structure to common-but-complicated activities. While [Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/) remains the primary resource for rules for this game, this section houses information on any rules that are useful to be able to link to within the wiki, as well as any rules variants and house rules we will be using for this game. 

>[!recite|c-yellow] Demographics

This section outlines and describes the various [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestries]] and [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Versatile Heritages\|Versatile Heritages]] that you might encounter (or play as!) in this setting. 

>[!recite|c-green] Gazetteer

The primary guidebook to the locations, landmarks, and geographical features of our setting. 

>[!recite|c-gray] Dramatis Personae

The primary guidebook to the most important characters of this setting. Find information related to notable [[Factions\|Factions]] here. 

>[!recite|c-blue] Common Knowledge

The information in this section represents common knowledge and experiences of an average person in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. Some of these details are things that may require [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|recalling knowledge]] or might be more familiar to those with specialized experience or relevant backgrounds, but generally do not require higher education or extensive training. 

>[!recite|c-purple] Scholarly Details

While all the information found in Common Knowledge is likely to be a part of normal life for an average citizen, these topics are subjects that typically require an educated mind and/or specific training. Players are free to browse this section at their leisure, but your characters must have an appropriate background and/or make meaningful efforts in-game (such as talking to NPCs, [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Research/Research\|researching]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|recalling knowledge]], or [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|gathering information]]) to gain full access to this knowledge.
