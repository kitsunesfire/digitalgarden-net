# Session Zero Notes

- Running the Game 
	- General Expectations 
		- **Be heroic.** That means no PVP / murder hobo / reckless endangerment. I expect the world to see you as heroes, so I also expect you to act the part.
		- **Be heartfelt.** Everyone is working really hard to bring to life characters they care a lot about. It's important to me that this creative process is respected. When you are at the table, you should always assume that everyone is trying their best to play true to their character, and that their abilities and comfort zone may be different from yours. When you notice someone really shining, do your best to take note-- most of our sessions will end with an opportunity to shout out these kinds of things. Please note however, that these comments are only meant to be purely positive; it is never okay to make fun of someone else for putting themselves out there or for taking a creative risk. 
		- **Be helpful.** This is a team game, and I rely on each of you to help me and help each other. I fully expect you to be the experts on your own characters and to call things out if I miss one of your abilities or feats. You shouldn't hesitate to ask your team for advice when you can't make up your mind on what skill to boost, and you should be actively looking for ways that you (and your character) can be helping someone else. 
		- **Be humble.** It's important to share the spotlight. While everyone can (and should!) have their own moments to shine, this campaign is about a *party* of heroes, not about one individual hero. It's okay to feel frustrated-- maybe you feel that you have been taking a back seat (or forced to step back) for a long time. If that's the case, please share these feelings with me-- or better yet, with your party!-- so we can work on a solution together. 
		- **Be honorable**. I am an extremely permissive GM, and honestly, that isn't something I am likely to change, nor do I really want to. I trust you all to act in good faith, whether that's in how you're rolling your dice or the inventory you have on your sheet or the feats you have on your character. I expect you to be honorable, and to not take advantage of my faith in you. 
		- **Be honest.** If something isn't working for you or doesn't feel right, it's really important to me that you let me know. I can't fix problems I don't know about, and I can't improve without feedback. Only you know what is right for you. 
		- **Be healthy.** Take care of yourselves first. No game is more important than your well-being. If you aren't feeling 100%, feel free to join in remotely, if you're able. But if that's not possible, please just let me know as soon as you can-- no hard feelings. 
		- **Be here.** I expect that you prioritize game night. You should plan to make every session. Shit happens, of course, but this should not a "negotiable" or "maybe" slot on your calendar; it's booked unless something goes wrong.
	- Attendance
		- Schedule
			- Currently planning to be bi-weekly sessions on Saturdays. Start time is negotiable, but plan to end late
				- We always have at least 2 long breaks for food, but I am also trying to be better at remembering to take smaller breaks as well. More on that later!
			- Remote gameplay is always on the table, especially in cases of bad weather or poor mental/physical health. There will always be an option to sign up as a remote player in the scheduling post; if you previously signed up as "in person" but want to change your mind, just let me know
		- Cancellation policy
			- Life happens and scheduling conflicts occur. Obviously, the more advance notice I have, the better. 
				- As a general rule, if the session does not have 4 players I will not run it
				- If I have enough advance notice, I might be able to enlist a guest player to fill in for a missing player. Otherwise, I will have to cancel the session 
				- If you need to cancel last-minute, please just let me know as soon as possible so I know not to be waiting for you
			- Repeated cancellations will result in a warning. Multiple warnings will result in getting replaced as a player in the campaign
	- Communication & Privacy
		- Survey Results
			- Consent, Lines & Veils 
			- [[1. Overview/New Player Information/Community Standards\|Community Standards]] 
		- GM Assistant
	- Tools 
		- Discord
			- The entirety of my communication regarding this campaign is done via Discord. I also prefer that all game-related conversations rest in the SMK server, so that if I need to reference something later I can find it again and not have to sift through personal conversations. It also helps me maintain my high personal standards of privacy for each of you :) 
		- Obsidian
			- This one is pretty major. I've put a ton of work into making our Obsidian as robust as possible, and there's always more that is being added. It's the closest I've got to a digital brain, and I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with it as much as you are able. It's there to help <3 
		- Foundry 
			- This is arguably the most important one. Since we have one permanently remote player, I'm going to lean fully into digitally running this campaign. As much as I can, I am going to try to have absolutely everything in either Foundry or Obsidian (in some cases, both). Please do your best to have your character sheets in Foundry up to date and accurate. 
		- Pathbuilder 
			- Far and away the best tool for (mechanically) building your characters. I'm doing my absolute best to make sure that everything you need to mechanically represent for your character can be reflected in Pathbuilder :) 
- The Campaign: Age of Ascension 
	- Campaign themes 
		- Dramatic Questions
			- What makes us who we are? Can we change who we are? Should we try?
				- What makes a good leader? What makes a hero?
				- Can meddling with ancient powers ever end well?
				- What does peace look like? When is a conflict truly over?
		- Top 5 Traits
			- Heroism
			- Strategy
			- Intrigue
			- Dungeons
			- Comradery  
		- Top 5 Video Game RPG Influences
			- Baldur's Gate 3
			- Persona 5
			- Tales of Arise
			- Final Fantasy 16
			- Witcher 3
	- Campaign structure
		- Levels 1 - 20
		- 5 chapters, plus a prologue
			- Each chapter will feature at least one mandatory major chapter boss and at least one optional dungeon area 
			- Prologue primarily takes place inside Oblivion, and covers levels 1-4
				- Currently thinking of starting at either level 1 or 2, but open to feedback 
		- Multiple gameplay/ story arcs, including:
			- Dungeon Crawl 
			- Gritty Adventure
			- High Adventure 
			- Horror 
			- Intrigue 
			- Military Adventure 
			- Mystery 
			- Planar Adventure 
			- Romantic Adventure 
		- 4 campaign-long  "Aeon Quests"
			- Heavily inspired by BG3's Companion Quests
		- Opportunities for other campaign-long sub-plots  
		- "Tour Bus" style 
			- Fairly open world, with a plot that is mostly on rails (but still heavily influenced by player choice). Kinda Baldur's Gate 3 style. Swing for the fences, right? 
			- Right off the bat, as soon as you get out of prison, you will all be faced with your first major team decision that will dramatically alter the course of the entire campaign. Think-- Fire Emblem Three Houses. Use your time in Oblivion to get to know each other's characters-- and most importantly, to build trust.
	- Gameplay Mechanics
		- Official variant rules 
			- Remastered Content
			- [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Free Archetype\|Free Archetype]]  
			- [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Ancestral Paragon\|Ancestral Paragon]]
			- [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Automatic Bonus Progression/Automatic Bonus Progression\|Automatic Bonus Progression]] 
			- No alignment 
		- Unofficial rules
			- Deep Backgrounds + [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] 
			- [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] ([[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Aeon Mechanics/Aeon Mechanics\|Aeon Mechanics]])
				- Aeons effectively grow with you over the course of the campaign, moving from "Summoner Archetype Lite" to "Summoner Archetype" to "Dual Class Summoner" and finally "Dual Class Summoner Plus" right at the very end ;) 
			- [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] / [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Language Proficiency\|Language Proficiency]] 
				- While the language rules have not changed from Campaign 2, please note that for this part of the world, Common isn't "Common"-- it's [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]]. This means you all still start with Common by default, and will need to either select [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]] as a language or have your character take time in [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]] working on learning it 
			- [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]] / [[0. Archive/Leisure/Leisure Activities\|Leisure Activities]]   
			- [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Lore Skill Adjustments\|Lore Skill Adjustments]]
				- The important things to keep in mind are that I like to use lore skills more often and more liberally than the game typically expects. Because of this, I will often give you opportunities to scale up lore skills for free (so you don't have to spend a precious skill increase on them), and will frequently give out lore skills as rewards for quests or downtime. 
				- Per the last campaign, I am going to continue doing lore checks as *hidden* rather than *secret* rolls-- meaning, both you and I know the result, but the party does not. There are easy ways to do this in Foundry, and for those of you rolling in person, I am hoping to get a dice tower set up to make this just as easy for physical dice. 
				- Unlike the last campaign, I am doing away with regional lore skills. I will still have each of you start the game with a number of lore skills for free, but they will be generated out of your Background and your initial time in [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]] instead of from your home region. 
			- BattleZoo [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestries]] 
				- Currently in the process of adding some additional ancestries from BattleZoo, since they are high quality 3rd party content and have published/ are publishing some ancestries that are highly relevant to this setting. Most notably: 
					- Dragons
					- Angels
					- Devils 
					- Werecreatures
					- Psychopomps
					- Demons
					- Doppelgangers 
					- Nymphs 
					- Sidhe 
					- Gremlins 
					- Oni 
				- These ancestries will be included in our Obsidian and available as options in our Foundry and on Pathbuilder once I have them all set up on my end, but please note that some of the above are announced for later this year and are not available yet. That said, if you are interested in changing your character concept to play as one of the above, let me know and we can work something out :) 
		- Unconfirmed rules
			- Monster-Hunter-Style looting & crafting 
				- Ready to go, but need y'all to buy in and confirm your interest 
			- Heroic Crafting 
				- Another possible alternative to the standard crafting system
	- Modes of play
		- Downtime expectations
			- I expect this campaign to have some meaningful periods of downtime in between chapters (and sometimes within chapters as well). It is important to start thinking about what kinds of personal goals your character might have, or what they might want to do with their free time 
			- I have more robust options for [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]] than standard Pf2e to help give suggestions, but you are in no way limited to only the activities listed :) Use your imagination! 
		- Exploration expectations 
			- How do we want to handle navigation? 
		- Combat expectations
			- The game is balanced around the assumption that you will be around close to full health for every encounter. This necessitates a playstyle that is tactical, often much more-so than games like D&D. It is expected that you move slowly in hazardous areas and find ways to rest up and heal in between encounters. Otherwise, you will likely die. 
				- A healer is not required. Somebody with medicine and feat investments towards healing *is* required
			- Combat in general is incredibly tactical. It requires teamwork and the use of skills and abilities beyond just moving and striking. Your party is counting on you to use your full toolbox! Everyone does different things well, but nobody can do anything well unless you work together.
			- PF2e actually has working stealth rules. To the extent that you can play this system like Metal Gear Solid. I will be studying them hard, and doing my best to set up our foundry maps with accurate visibility. Please make use of it.
		- Social expectations 
			- With this group in particular, I expect roleplay to be a focus. However, if it ever starts to feel like there's an imbalance (either not enough opportunities for meaningful RP or too much of an emphasis on it), please let me know! 
		- Other [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Subsystems\|Subsystems]] 
			- I made a subsystem for "[[0. Archive/Leisure/Leisure\|Leisure]]" mode in our last campaign, which is effectively short term downtime that you can take while at camp. We might use it, we might not 
			- I like to use skill challenges to resolve things that are difficult to do in standard encounter mode 
			- We have tried the Infiltration rules, Vehicle rules and Research rules from the official subsystems... and each time, I've been frustrated and disappointed. Still willing to give them another go, but I've not been terribly impressed by the official subsystems. But there's a good chance it's just me not getting it
	- Items & Treasure
		- On Rarities 
			- In general, anything tagged as Uncommon or Rare needs GM approval 
			- There are some things that I have [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Rarity Adjustments\|adjusted the rarity]] for in this setting; a list of these changes can be found in our Obsidian 
		- Relics
			- This is something I'd love to work on collaboratively with each of you, because I want it to be something meaningful to each of your characters and something that excites you as players. There are some extra relic aspects and gifts that you will have access to in addition to the standard selection-- all of this information is available in our Obsidian. Please take some time to browse through and brainstorm what sounds exciting for your character *in this moment*, knowing that they are also expected to grow and change during their adventure (and therefore might surprise you-- or both of us!).
			- That said-- there are some options listed that are either highly situational or outright not available for balance and/or narrative reasons. For this reason, I ask that you try your best not to get *too* attached to any one aspect or gift. If I have time, I'll go through and make note of the restricted options, but for now I think it's more important that you just have all of the information 
		- Starting equipment 
			- Please use the official guidelines for starting loot. I recommend (but don't require) you to pick up your relevant class kit as pat of your starting equipment 
			- We will also talk in our 1x1s about some flavor and fluff for things in your inventory :) 
			- I think it's pretty obvious that, given your incarceration, you won't actually *start* with your starting equipment. While you should be reunited with your belongings very shortly, just keep in mind that the very beginning of the first session will be with little more than the clothes on your back
		- Special mention: Zarthura & Innovation 
			- It's worth noting that, in our world, Zarthura is quite famous for being inventive and innovative. They are more likely than most to try new things, experiment, and tinker. They also have greater access to some rare and unusual ingredients, due to their proximity to exotic realms. As a result, some weapons/ weapon types/ equipment/ formulae that are rare or uncommon elsewhere might have decreased rarity in this region, and some items that are not heard of anywhere else might show up here. For example:
				- Elven weaponry is more common 
				- Mithril is (slightly) more common 
				- Elysian bronze is (moderately) more common 
				- There are rules for trick weapons / modular weapons 
				- Some poisons and potions are more readily available 
				- Some unique flora, fauna, and materials will show up 
				- It may be possible to pick up crafting skill increases and crafting-related feats more easily :) 
		- Wish lists! 
			- PLEASE keep track of loot you are looking forward to in future levels and flag that to me. I am going to do my absolute best in planning ahead for future loot drops and will always try to keep your characters in mind, but you know your characters better than I do. Let me know what gets you excited to open a chest! 
	- Experience Tracking
		- I usually run Milestone leveling, but I would like to try tracking experience points for this campaign. I know there will be a bit of a learning curve-- for me especially, because it means leaning the experience values of a lot of things and even more math to keep track of. BUT, if I'm honest, I think it will help me keep better track of things that I really should be doing a better job of anyway, and I think it will help me be a better Pf2e GM. 
	- Character Death
			- I intend to run this campaign with death mechanics as written-- your primary limiting factors on attempting resurrection are access to diamonds and succeeding the necessary checks to perform the ritual/spell 
				- That said, I'm considering taking the unusual nature of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] into account. It's close proximity to the realm of the dead *might* change the rules somewhat, but I'm not sure. Regardless, I will only consider making [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Resurrection\|Resurrection]] easier, not harder. Zarthura is deadly enough already. 
			- As of now, I don't think anyone has access to the Divine spell list (except Yannick) and I'm not sure how many of you are investing in the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Religion\|Religion]] skill. While this might change by the time the Raise Dead spell is relevant (it's a level 6 spell after all), just... keep that in mind :) 
			- There is a faction in this campaign who will serve as your primary healers. Seek them out in case of emergency [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Resurrection\|Resurrection]] needs; they will always be able to help, but if you don't have a diamond be prepared to make a devil's deal ;) 
			- Additional means of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Resurrection\|Resurrection]] may become available as the campaign progresses
	- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Creation\|Character Creation]]
		- Background + [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] 
		- 1x1 Sessions 
		- NPC cards 
		- Oblivion adventure
- The Setting: The Eternian Isles 
	- Setting overview
		- This campaign will primarily take place on the mainland of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], but will almost certainly include some of the neighboring area(s), such as [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Ansteigen\|Ansteigen]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]; the extent to which these supplemental areas are included and explored is largely up to you and your level of interest 
	- Notable lore changes from previous iterations of SMK
		- Swapped [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Ansteigen\|Ansteigen]] and The [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/United Altos Isles\|United Altos Isles]] on the world map
		- In the process of rewriting / revising the Obsidian page for [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. Stay tuned 
		- Beastkin are now from Arcadia and associated with [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]], [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldling]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Wyldlands\|Wyldlands]] 
			- Fey-touched feats are now Uncommon for these [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestries]] instead of Rare
		- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]] belong to a *much* bigger [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|pantheon]]
			- We have 75 gods now, y'all. I won't make you all lose your minds by going through each one by one now, and as I'm sure you can imagine there's a lot I still need to add to that section. But for now, if you're interested, go ahead and browse. If you want to know more about any of the gods, just ask 
		- Reduction of Magical Traditions; introduction of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Alternative Magic\|Alternative Magic]] 
		- Added [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Sun Elf\|Sun Elf]] and [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Moon Elf\|Moon Elf]] as Elven Heritages
		- Added Vampiric Ancient Elf as an Elven Heritage
		- Revised [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Extraplanar/Seraph\|Seraph]] [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Extraplanar/Devil\|Devil]] [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]] [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Archfey\|Archfey]] 
			- less of an emphasis on "purpose", a little more open ended overall
		- Revised [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] 
			- Added [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Fey Sidhe/The Fey Sidhe\|The Fey Sidhe]]
		- Separated out the concepts of Changelings and [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Artificial/Doppelganger\|Doppelganger]] 
			- The lore that used to belong to our Changelings is now Doppelganger lore, and Changelings have their canon lore back 
		- Cleaned up the lore around the [[Sources of Magic\|Sources of Magic]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] 
		- Cleaned up some [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmology\|Cosmology]] stuff
			- Eliminated the other material realms, simplified some other things, pulled a lot more of it into this realm/region :)
		- Revised the [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Calendar & Clock\|Calendar & Clock]], simplified [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Holidays/Holidays\|Holidays]] 
			- Now, we have 12 months of 30 days with 5 intercalary holidays (modeled after the Forgotten Realms calendar, out of ease and simplicity) 
		- Removed a bunch of the extra [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Specialty Items\|Specialty Items]] 
		- Removed most of the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]]-specific information, since most of it is now outdated and/or irrelevant and no longer the primary focus of the campaign
			- Most of the creatures that were [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] in the last campaign are still here (i.e. shadows, wraiths, undead, etc), they just aren't likely to be referred to as [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] anymore by the common people
	- Some context / background 
		- I'm currently imagining this campaign to be set about 150 years after the last one (just to give plenty of time for the dust to settle and to let the immediate aftermath of the last campaign be more abstract rather than fresh details)
		- This means it will have been about 250 years since Val'Drah's canonic disappearance and the absolute and utter collapse of the former Kingdom of Ansteigen
	- Some key factions 
		- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]]
