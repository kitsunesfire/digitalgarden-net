# Attendance

## Schedule

- Currently planning to be bi-weekly sessions on Saturdays. Start time is negotiable, but plan to end late
- We always have at least 1 long break for food, but I am also trying to be better at remembering to take smaller breaks as well. Please don't hesitate to remind me, or just step away if you need to!
- Remote gameplay is always on the table, especially in cases of bad weather or poor mental/physical health. There will always be an option to sign up as a remote player in the scheduling post; if you previously signed up as "in person" but want to change your mind, just let me know

## Cancellation policy

- Life happens and scheduling conflicts occur. Obviously, the more advance notice I have, the better. 
- As a general rule, if the session does not have 4 players I will not run it
- If I have enough advance notice, I might be able to enlist a guest player to fill in for a missing player. Otherwise, I will have to cancel the session 
- If you need to cancel last-minute, please just let me know as soon as possible so I know not to be waiting for you
- Repeated cancellations will result in a warning. Multiple warnings will result in getting replaced as a player in the campaign
