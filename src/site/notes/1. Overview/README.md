# Sharum Mal'Kari Wiki
 
Welcome to the private Obsidian wiki for Sharum Mal'Kari, a custom setting for PF2e. 

**DISCLAIMER**: This content is for private tabletop use only, and not intended for monetary gain. Many of the concepts, themes, items, and titles within are uniquely connected but not wholly original, and I take no personal credit for any of the included artwork. 

If this is your first time visiting, please take a moment to review the [[1. Overview/New Player Information/Using This Wiki\|Using This Wiki]] page. If you've been here before, I encourage you to reference the [[1. Overview/Change Log\|Change Log]] for any significant alterations since your last visit. 

I'm looking forward to telling many great stories together!
