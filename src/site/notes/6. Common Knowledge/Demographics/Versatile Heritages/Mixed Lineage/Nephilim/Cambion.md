# Cambion

Cambions, also known as tieflings, are [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] planar scions native to [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] who have a strong affinity for the powers of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]. They are often distrusted and feared for these talents. 

Cambions are fertile in their own right, and it is common for them to have children and for those children to be cambions in turn. However, a chance also exists for the child of a cambion couple to be an outwardly normal member of their parents' species. Cambions are rarely welcomed in humanoid society due to their fiendish descent and outwardly fiendish appearances. As such, many cambions live in ghettos and other undesirable areas of their settlements. Some cambions attempt to counteract this stigma by amassing personal wealth or power, while others seek to form communities with other cambions where they can live without needing to hide their natures. Occasionally, cambions associate with other marginalized or distrusted species, such as half-orcs.
