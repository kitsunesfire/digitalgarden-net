[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|Wraith]] are [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] that result from [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]], or the spirits of the dead who stay in the living world instead of departing to [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]]. Consumed by sadness and rage, they are often twisted reflections of the person they were in life, ranging from an embodiment of their greatest desire to an appearance reflecting a misdeed. There are also [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|wraiths]] who seemingly come into existence without having been alive to begin with, suggesting that there may be other causes for a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|wraith]] to take form.
