Said to be born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Perhaps shaped by [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Sacred Dragons/The Sacred Dragons\|The Sacred Dragons]] or by the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|dragons]] themselves, [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] emerged from the Tearfall as a unique ancestry that combines many of the best attributes of both dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn see themselves as faithful servants to "true" [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|dragons]], but many find themselves adrift in an unwelcome world with no clear calling. 

To any [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]], the clan is more important than life itself. [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] have a very difficult time finding acceptance in Sharum Mal'Kari, which makes them all the more attached to the communities that have accepted them. They typically believe that each person's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan is the greatest sin that one can commit. 

A continual drive for self-improvement reflects on the self-sufficiency of the ancestry as a whole. [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they are willing to give up. Members of other ancestries who share this same commitment and tenacity will find it easy to earn the respect of a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]]. 

Though all [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] strive to be entirely self-sufficient, they do recognize that help is needed to overcome difficult situations. In these times, a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] will first turn towards their clan. If the clan needs help, they are far more likely to seek the help of other mortals before they petition the gods-- even [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Sacred Dragons/The Sacred Dragons\|The Sacred Dragons]]-- as they often feel that they have been betrayed by these higher powers.
