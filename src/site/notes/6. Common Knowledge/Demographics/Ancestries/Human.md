[Humans](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=6) are ambitious, versatile, unpredictable and capable of nearly anything. They are associated with [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|soma]] magic and are among the most capable and likely users of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]]. Humans are by far the most common and most diverse ancestry in the world; otherworldly beings tend to identify this both as humanityâ€™s greatest weakness and strength.

Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead might mighty armies to conquer their neighbors-- for no better reason than because they can.

## Setting Notes

- Humans are far and away the most common ancestry on Sharum Mal'Kari, even compared to other "common" ancestries.
