 [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demons]] are celestial beings that inhabit dark realms-- the most common being [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demons]] often have a frightening, chimerical appearance, though this is not true for all [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demons]]. In fact, it has been noted that, generally speaking, the more humanoid the demon looks, the more powerful they are, with weaker demons often taking on more beastlike or monstrous appearances. Even so, [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demons]] commonly manifest in forms that feature attributes of apex predators, such as powerful wings, sharp claws, curved horns, sensitive ears, or eyes that can see in the dark.
