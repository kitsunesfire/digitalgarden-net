[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|Malaks]] are entities that are elemental in nature and are native to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]]. They are specialists of a particular kind of magic called [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Artes]], which channel energy from the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]]. There are eight types of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Malak Artes]]: [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]]. 

There are nearly infinite different forms a malak might take. As embodiments of the various elemental energies of the cosmos, malaks are frequently viewed as forces of both creation and destruction. Most malaks like to live in places of nature, where the natural flow of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] is strong and can be accessed more freely. Furthermore, they also tend to exhibit a preference for terrain that suits their chosen [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Arte]], such as a fire malak choosing to live near a volcano, an air malak living atop a mountain, or a water malak living on an island or oasis.

While all beings with [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] may at least some minor affinity to at least one of the eight [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Malak Artes]], beings with an unusually high affinity, or “[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]]”, are capable of forging powerful bonds with malaks of that same [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|arte]]. These bonds, often called “[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]]”, are potent exchanges of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] that can result in a wide variety of effects, including but not limited to enhanced strength, elemental defenses, magical capabilities, increased mobility, and an extended lifespan. Most malaks prefer to live independently, but some may choose to form a pact with a mortal. While most [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] that are formed are done so willingly, there are some who force malaks to forge [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]], subjecting them to a long lifetime of servitude—for no matter the nature of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|pact]], the only way to break it is through death.

[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] are entities that are empowered by (or embody) a variety of spiritual or natural phenomena. They can represent elements of the landscape, forces of nature, beings and the qualities those beings express, and/or spirits of the dead. Many [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] are considered the ancient ancestors of entire [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestries]], and, according to some myths, great heroes and leaders may become an [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparition]] upon their death.

[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] are strongly associated with the material plane. They are not separate from nature, but are *of* nature, possessing both "good" and "evil" characteristics. They are manifestations of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Flow\|Flow]]-- the interconnecting energy of the universe-- and are believed to be "hidden" from the senses of mortals. They are highly mobile, traveling frequently between their various places of inhabitance (such as sacred places, natural phenomena, or homes of worshippers who welcome them in) but never staying any one place for too long. 

There are many different varieties of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]]. There are over 300 different classifications of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] known to modern scholars, and even that number is likely to be a modest estimate; there is much we do not know about the nature and existence of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]]. While an incredible amount of diversity exists within the different types of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]], there are a few qualities that appear to be universal truths to their nature:

- [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] are of a dualistic nature. They can nurture and love when respected, or they can cause destruction and disharmony when disregarded. [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] must be appeased in order to gain their favor and avoid their wrath. 
- All [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparitions]] have a duty to the people around them. Just as the people have an obligation to keep an [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparition]] happy, the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|Apparition]] has to perform specific duties to offer aid in return-- usually in relation to the specific function of the object or place they inhabit.
