# Fey

True [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] are supernatural beings originating from the mythic wilds of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]]. While effectively immortal in their homeland, they still have mortal souls. They cannot die without the intervention of extremely powerful magic, and in most cases simply reform from the matter of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]] after some variable amount of time. 

Typically, [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] are born aligned to one season and stay aligned to their season for the rest of their lives. This, however, it not always the case. While it is uncommon, it is possible for a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] to shift seasons, either as the result of a ritual or in response to an emotionally powerful event. Rarer still, it is also possible for a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] to be born unaligned or to remove their alignment completely; these [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] are known as [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]], and are often outcasts in [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] society. 

All [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] are capable of changing their physical appearance according to their mood, though they generally assume characteristics that suit their season. It is common for their eyes to shine, giving away the wellspring of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] that flows inside them. Their hair and skin colors are extremely varied, though they tend to remain vaguely within the color palette of their season. 

No matter their appearance, every [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] possess abilities that are dependent on the season towards which they have the greatest affinity-- most often the season of their birth. For example, an [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] might be able to invoke a fiery aggression, instilling fear in the hearts of all creatures in their proximity, while a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Spring Fey\|Spring Fey]] might call upon the feelings of renewal and rebirth in order to cast healing magic. Despite all of these variations, all [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] share many common traits, such as a deep respect for personal freedom, a great love for beauty and art, and a desire to surround themselves with beautiful things. 

Most [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] tend to be highly social and gravitate towards jobs or societal roles where they will be seen by or interact with the public, whether working in restaurants or performing on a stage. [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] often prize fame and recognition, wanting themselves or the people close to them to be known and remembered, and many take up artistic hobbies like songwriting, poetry, or painting to memorialize people and places they hold dear. 

[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] can often have customs that are unintentionally cruel or murderous to outsiders due to their immortality in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]]. They tend to see death as a nebulous thing that rarely has real consequences. 

Fey sometimes make magical agreements, or fey bargains, in which they imbue a trade partner with limited supernatural power in exchange for something that is always unusual and personal, such as the first syllable of the person's name or the ability to see the moon. Breaking such a bargain brings a significant curse upon the oath-breaker, and attempting to end the bargain prematurely always heightens its cost. The more powerful the fey, the more potent their boon.
