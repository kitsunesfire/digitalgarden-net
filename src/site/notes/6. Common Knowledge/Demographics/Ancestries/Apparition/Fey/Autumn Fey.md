The [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]]'s sharp eyes are as likely to be silver or gold as the jewel tones of their favored treasures. Many wear motifs of leaves, ancient whorls, branches and bare bone etched intricately into their leather clothing and the weave of their cloaks. Knights may wear intricate leather armor, arm-bands, and belts in varied and muted colors, though copper, gold, and red are the most common. Ladies of the Court, when not fighting alongside the men, often wear flowing dresses in rich russet or soft auburn tones, offset by lovely winding belts on which they hang their best swords. The [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] are very fond of jewelry, especially rare gems won at tournaments or on the field of combat. 

The [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] are the most warlike of the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]. They have strong passions, and are not afraid to act. Impulsive and decisive, they are willing to take great risks to accomplish their goals. This often makes them fine leaders; when they command, others follow. They are capable of great courage and inspirational deeds against overwhelming odds. The [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] live bright, fearless lives, taking joy in everything they do. They do not fear death in battle because they believe that true immortality lies in living richly and being remembered for valorous and noble deeds. 

[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] can be fiercely competitive. All [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] seek perfection, but [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] seek it in order to best their rivals. They tend to collect rivals-- and since that rivalry is usually martial, the shedding of blood and even duels to the death are not uncommon. If both parties survive, however, they are likely to become fast friends and fight side-by-side from that day forward. [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] work and fight well in groups of loyal friends who watch each other's backs. 

Vicious tempers are another notable trait of many autumn-born. They are easily provoked to violent anger and do not forget their grievances; they may still despise and seek to destroy their enemies decades or even generations later. Conversely, [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] are capable of great loyalties that surpass death. Beloved comrades-in-arms have often been buried together in a single grave, and generations later, their decedents may still fight at each other's sides. 

The most noble of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] follow individual codes of honor. This may involve acts of great generosity, showing mercy to fallen enemies and those weaker than themselves, or never asking for or accepting help in a battle. 

## Autumn Eladrin in Society 

[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] are best known for their feats of strength. Groups of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] often form warbands of some common cause, or just to pursue the joy of hunting. The autumn-born are classic knight-errants, traveling from one place to another in pursuit of challenge and adventure. They are equally good at defending their own domains, however, and often rise to become a Lord or Lady, even if they were not born to it, simply by proving themselves stronger and more noble than the previous claimant to the title. 

Most [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] become fighters or champions; it is extremely rare for an [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Autumn Fey\|Autumn Fey]] to have the skills and patience required to become a mage (or even an interest in such a thing).
