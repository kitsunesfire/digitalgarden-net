The [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] are an ancient (and somewhat alien) sub-group of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|Elf]] that are said to have constructed many wonders that once dotted the landscape of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. Historic accounts have often depict them as refined, graceful warriors and wizards, who tended to excel in disciplines such as magic, alchemy, and swordplay. Despite their many accomplishments, at some point in the distant past the mighty [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elven]] civilization collapsed-- likely due to some sort of civil war. While the historical records of this time are sparse, it is believed that, somehow, this conflict caused them to lose a great deal of their celestial abilities and (for the most part) abandon the mainland of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]... though not necessarily in that order. 

Overall, [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] have a reputation for being elitist, racist, arrogant, and condescending to other [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestries]]-- even other [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|Elf]]. In truth, however, it is more likely than not that the average [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elf]] holds far more prejudice  and disdain towards other types of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] than they do towards any other ancestry-- likely a product of their many centuries of in-fighting.

The [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] are considered to be native to the lands currently occupied by the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], and are often associated with ancient celestial powers. They are most commonly of average height with a slim build; even exceptionally strong [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] tend to look rather slim compared to other ancestries. Their skin tones tend towards the extremes of either ivory-fair or ebony-dark, frequently with an otherworldly lavender or pearlized sheen. Most [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] have white hair, but other variances along the monochromatic spectrum are not unheard of; colored hair, on the other hand, is quite rare. High elves eyes, unlike human eyes, can be found in nearly any hue imaginable, and more often than not have iridescent or metallic flecks through the iris. 

Many varieties of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elves]] may have existed at different points in history across the realms. Of these, there are two that can be found in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]: [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Moon Elf\|moon elves]] and [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Sun Elf\|sun elves]].
