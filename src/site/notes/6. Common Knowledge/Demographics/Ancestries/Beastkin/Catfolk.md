[Catfolk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=17) are outgoing, active humanoids who delight in discovery, whether of hidden ruins or a comfortable place to nap. They are exceptionally social, both within their tight-knit communities and with other creatures they meet. Remarkably brave, catfolk see themselves as guardians of the world against forces that would assail it, and they believe that strong communities, breadth of experience, and continual self-improvement aid them in this fight. 

Catfolk have fast reflexes and are even able to twist themselves in the air while falling to land on their feet. As quick as these reflexes are, catfolk have quicker tempers, shifting from effusive glee to aggrieved fury in an instant. Like mundane felines, catfolk involuntarily purr when pleased and growl when surprised or angry. 

Catfolk delight in venturing into unexplored areas, whether untrammeled wildernesses or ancient dungeons. They like finding treasures and baubles, but for most catfolk, the experience of the journey itself is the truest reward.

Catfolk are known for their luck. Many catfolk tend to experience this luck as an insistent urge that feels like a warning from a benevolent presence they can't perceive. Others experience it as a reflexive awareness of danger beyond their normal senses.
