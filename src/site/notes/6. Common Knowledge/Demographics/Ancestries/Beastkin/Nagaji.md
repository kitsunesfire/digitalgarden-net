[Nagaji](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=54) tend to make up some of the most capable warriors in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]]. Recognizable from their serpentine lidless eyes and affinity for body piercings and jewelry, nagaji place honor, devotion and dedication above all else. Though nagaji have serpentine bodies by nature, they possess the ability to alternate between this form and a more human one. Strong of body and personality, they tend to display talents for both swords and sorcery and usually work as monster hunters and bodyguards for the elite.

Nagaji are the ancestral caretakers of ancient [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthan]] ruins and as such are known to hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths. If nagaji can be said to share any singular trait, it is devotion-- to a community, a temple, a concept, or a lifestyle. Most nagaji are also drawn to the spiritual in all its expressions, including some of the darker and more mystical aspects of philosophies and religions.

Nagaji communities widely vary, from settlements centered around ancient ruins to tiny fishing villages. They often live alongside [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Lizardfolk\|Lizardfolk]] and [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]], but are usually isolated from other populations (more as a matter of convenience than choice, due to their preference for living in marshes and wetlands). Though they most commonly live in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Cheongai\|Cheongain]] concepts of medicine, spirituality, and occult worship are extremely popular in their culture, especially given their tendency of seeing themselves as highly pious beings. Nagaji typically have little physical need for clothes, as they often inhabit hot and humid environments, though nagaji wear them with pride and treat them as decorative elements in the same manner as jewelry. 

As nagaji are usually matriarchal, they have a strong respect for women in leadership positions. Nagaji tend to trace linage through the mother, and female children are typically given preferential treatment. 

## Setting Notes

- [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Nagaji\|Nagaji]] are Common in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]] but Uncommon in other regions; they have significant representation in the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Cheongai\|Cheongai]] and around certain oases in the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]] 
- Unlike the standard setting of Pf2e, nagaji in Sharum Mal'Kari do not have any particular relationship or association with nagas (apart from their name and appearance).
