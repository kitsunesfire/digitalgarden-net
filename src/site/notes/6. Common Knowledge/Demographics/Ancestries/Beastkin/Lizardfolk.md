[Lizardfolk](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=15) are consummate survivors. They move through the societies of humanoids with the steely reserve of born predators, and have a well-deserved reputation as outstanding rangers and unsentimental fighters. 

Though lizardfolk have adapted to many different environments, many of them still prefer to remain near bodies of water, using their ability to hold their breath to their advantage. As a result, lizardfolk usually prefer equipment that is not easily damaged by moisture, eschewing leather and metal for gear made of stone, ivory, glass, and bone. 

The simply constructed huts and villages that most of Sharum Mal'Kari associate with lizardfolk homes are only one facet of their rich, complex traditions. "True" lizardfolk settlements often blend in with surrounding ruins, as these stone and glass structures are usually at least partially submerged in water. 

Within their own settlements, lizardfolk tend to be raised communally from the moment they break from their shells. They are particularly fond of oral traditions, and have stories that have been passed on from generation to generation in the forms of epic poems and evocative carvings. Additionally, lizardfolk are frequently passionate astrologers with one eye to the future; if they seem slow to act, it is because their long history has taught them the value of patience.
