[Vishkanya](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=56) are ophidian humanoids who carry potent venom within their blood and saliva. Largely misunderstood due to old tales of their toxicity and natural finesse, vishkanya work to grow into more than just what stories paint them to be. 

Though they are very humanlike at first glance, their ophidian features become clear in close proximity. They tend to be quite tall and lithe with bright gem-colored eyes, vertical pupils, and a forked tongue. Where their scales are visible, they tend to be quite small and range from earthy tones of browns and greens to bright displays of colored patterns. 

Vishkanya are particularly well-known for their spell casting capabilities and often find work as mystics, fortune tellers and entertainers. They are said to have poisonous blood and hypnotizing beauty, and are generally characterized as deceptive and seductive beings that speak through forked tonguesâ€” both literally and metaphorically.

Vishkanya often have multiple partners, give birth in multiples, and adhere to maternal inheritances. Mixed vishkanya families aren't unknown. Vishkanya offspring from this background sometimes strongly resemble their non-vishkanya parent, with only a few stray tells such as sharp canine teeth to indicate the truth of their lineage. Children of vishkanya are generally free to choose their occupation and the nature of their contribution to the larger community, with many vishkanya pursuing some sort of [[2.

## Setting Notes

- [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]] are ==Rare==, but most commonly found in southern [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Gath\|Gath]], and eastern [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]]. They are strongly associated with the art of henna tattooing.
- Vishkanya might also be found working as a mercenary or an artist in various parts of Sharum Mal'Kari (but are always drawn towards warm climates)
