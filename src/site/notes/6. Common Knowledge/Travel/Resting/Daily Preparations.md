# Daily Preparations

Just before setting out to explore, or after a night’s rest, characters must spend time to prepare for the adventuring day. This typically happens over the span of 30 minutes to an hour in the morning, but only after 8 full hours of rest. Daily preparations include the following.

- Spellcasters who prepare spells choose which spells they’ll have available that day.
- Focus Points and other abilities that reset during daily preparations refresh. This includes abilities that can be used only a certain number of times per day.
- Each character equips their gear. This includes donning their armor and strapping on their weapons.
- Characters invest up to 10 worn magic items to gain their benefits for the day
