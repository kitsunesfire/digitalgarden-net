# Terrain Types

Most large-scale overland travel is done on the hexmap. Any given hex on the hexmap is assigned a [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Terrain Types\|terrain type]]. This doesn't mean that all terrain in the area is the same, but that those are the main features of the region. The main terrain types in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] are:

- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Aerial\|Aerial]] (Sky)
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Aquatic\|Aquatic]] 
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Arctic\|Arctic]] 
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Desert\|Desert]] 
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Forest\|Forest]] 
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Mountain\|Mountain]]
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Plains\|Plains]] 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sky\|Sky]] 
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Swamp\|Swamp]] 
- [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Underground\|Underground]] 

The type of terrain is also important for many feats and activities that relate to travelling and navigation, such as favored terrain and terrain expertise.
