# Plains

Mostly flat and unobstructed, plains are usually at lower elevations, but they can also be found at higher elevation on plateaus.

**Terrain** open terrain  
**Resources** useful plants (flax or cotton)  
**Secrets** artifacts abandoned after a historic battle, valuables buried by outlaws for later retrieval

## Plains Geomancy 

The vast expanse of grasslands represent limitless potential spanning off in every direction. Animals and caravans alike migrate across the plains, but humans and other sapient creatures also settle down and build farms. The openness of the plains calls for spells of the wind, plant cultivation, and fast, effortless travel. A geomancer on the plains feels the vastness within them, stretching as broad as the distant horizons.
