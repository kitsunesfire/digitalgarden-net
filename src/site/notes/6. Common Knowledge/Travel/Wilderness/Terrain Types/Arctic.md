# Arctic

Arctic environments usually appear near the northern and southern extremes of a world, though extreme elevation, unusually shaped worlds, and supernatural forces could result in arctic terrain elsewhere.

**Terrain** typically difficult or greater difficult terrain  
**Resources** scarce food (broken ice floes that allow for fishing, breeding grounds for seals or whales)  
**Secret** thawed passes that allow ship travel, hidden caverns, isolated communities of arctic dwellers

## Arctic Geomancy 

Icy winds carry crystalline flecks of snow that distort the horizons, and desolate nights bring undulating light shows to the black skies. An arctic environment draws a geomancer toward illusory magic that replicates the splendor and mystery of the sparkling tundras, and to long-lasting protection against the elements.
