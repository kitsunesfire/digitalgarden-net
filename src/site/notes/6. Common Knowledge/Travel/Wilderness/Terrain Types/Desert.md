# Desert

Deserts can appear anywhere on a world where precipitation is scant, even along some oceans. Any large landmasses that entirely lack bodies of water are likely to be deserts.

**Terrain** typically difficult or greater difficult terrain  
**Resources** water sources (underground springs, oases, and streams), mineral wealth  
**Secrets** forgotten civilizations beneath the dunes

## Desert Geomancy 

Sandstorms rage as the sun glares down oppressive heat, only to retreat into a frigid night. Life is harsh in the desert, and only the powerful and adaptable survive; the desert's geomantic energies reflect that truth. When the environment is unforgiving, so is the geomancer, who brings forth punishing magic as merciless as trackless stone and sizzling sand.
