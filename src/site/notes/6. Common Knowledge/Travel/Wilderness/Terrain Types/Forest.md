# Forest

The composition of a forest depends on the climate and the elevation, with thick jungles more common near an equator, hardwood forests in more temperate zones, and evergreens at higher latitudes and elevations. Most worlds have a tree line—an elevation above which trees can’t grow.

**Terrain** typically difficult terrain, or greater difficult terrain for a dense jungle  
**Resources** diverse flora and fauna, natural remedies, plentiful game  
**Secrets** bandit encampment, druid’s henge, fey-touched glade or mushroom circle

## Forest Geomancy 

Forest are defined by the thick growth of plants, a canopy of green home to creatures across every stratum from the forest floor to the treetops. All forests, from those of humid ferns to frozen conifers, share growth and creation. This generative power thrives in a geomancer, coming to life in spells that spring vines and thorns or call forth ancient creatures tied to the land.
