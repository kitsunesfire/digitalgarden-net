# Settlement Levels

A settlement's level represents its relative size and economic capacity, as well as roughly corresponding to the maximum level of NPC that can easily be found there-- not counting significant NPCs, of course. 

In general, any common items with a level no higher than the settlement's level are available for purchase (though a character of a higher level may be able to seek out or custom order higher-level items, with the right contacts and connections.) 

In addition, the settlement's level is used to help determine the maximum possible task level that could become available there to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Commerce/Earn Income\|Earn Income]]. However, all of this is meant as a guideline; your GM may make exceptions at their discretion. 

Village (Settlement Level 1)
Town (Settlement Level 2-4)
City (Settlement Level 5-9)
Metropolis (Settlement Level 10+)
