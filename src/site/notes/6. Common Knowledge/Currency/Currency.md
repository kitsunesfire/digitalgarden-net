Sharum Mal'Kari uses the "silver standard", meaning silver pieces are the standard form of currency used. The most common forms of coinage in Sharum Mal’Kari are:

- **Copper pence**— the base level of currency, most commonly used amongst peasants or for low-stakes gambling.
- **Silver sterling** — the standard form of currency used in Sharum Mal’Kari. Nearly all normal business transactions are quoted in sterling (SP)
- **Gold crowns** — the currency of the upper class; common enough to make its way into regular circulation in most cities, but outposts and small-time traders will likely have a hard time making change
- **Mithril markkas** — relics from the Age of Dragons, these colorful coins are mostly the stuff of treasure hoards and noblemen’s purses
- **Platinum lira**— platinum is reserved for jewelry or used for government level transfers of wealth; a literal king’s ransom. Lira are never available to the average citizen
