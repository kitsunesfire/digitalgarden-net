# Calendar & Clock

The calendar of Sharum Mal'Kari is split into twelve [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Months/Months\|months]], each lasting three tendays (or thirty days). There are an additional five international [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Holidays/Holidays\|holidays]] that fall in between months, bringing the total number of days in a year to 365. 

The days making up a tenday do not have formal names; if precision is required, the number of the day and/or the number of days within the number of tenday may be used. For example, the 14th day of Harabi might be referred to either as "Harabi fourteen" or "the fourth day of the second tenday of Harabi".

Sharum Mal'Kari has Earth-like rotations of seasons and 24-hour long days. In large settlements, bell towers ring each hour; for this reason, hours are sometimes referenced in units of “bells”, though most common folk are content to track the passage of time much more abstractly.
