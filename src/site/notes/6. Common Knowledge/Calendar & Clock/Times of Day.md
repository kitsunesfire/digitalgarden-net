# Times of Day

Adventuring days are divided into 4 segments: Daytime, Afternoon, Evening, and Nighttime. A party of adventurers needs to rest for at least 1 segment of an adventuring day in order to benefit from rest. 

## Daytime and Nighttime 

In general, the system assumes that the party is adventuring during the daytime and [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Resting/Resting\|Resting]] during the nighttime. However, if the party would like to instead adventure during the nighttime, the GM may make any or all of the following adjustments:

- Increase the DC of Survival skills, such as [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Sense Direction\|Sense Direction]] and [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Subsist\|Subsist]] 
- Increase the likelihood of random encounters
- Use different random encounters 

## Seasons & Daylight 

In temperate climates, the seasons have a major impact on the duration of days and nights. During Spring and Autumn, an adventuring day will have 2 segments of daylight and 2 segments of darkness. During Summer, the adventuring day has 3 segments of daylight and 1 of darkness, and in winter, there is only 1 segment of daylight and 3 of darkness. 

| Season | Segments in Daylight    | Segments in Darkness   |
| ------ | --- | --- |
| Spring | 2   | 2   |
| Summer | 3   | 1   |
| Autumn | 2   | 2   |
| Winter | 1   | 3   |{ #SeasonalDaylightDarkness}


In tropical climates, seasons don't have much impact in the duration of daylight, with most times of year behaving like Summer. However, in polar climates, the seasonal effect can by even more drastic, with 4 segments of darkness during Winter and 4 of daylight during Summer.
