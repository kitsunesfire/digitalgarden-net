# Education


## General Education
Zarthura is one of the only places in the world that commonly teaches sign language.

## Magic & Faith 
In the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], the advanced study of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|Magic]] is viewed with relish and almost covetous pride. As such, formal instructors almost exclusively teach a single student at a time in order to protect their own art. These studies are highly guarded, as a powerful mage can be worth a twenty [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Eternian Armed Forces\|soldiers]] when faced up against many of the all-too-common threats to Zarthurian society. Some Zarthurian spell books are filled with ancient theories that have been passed down from master to pupil for generations, with no other copies of some of their unique spells to be found anywhere else in the world.

## Technology & Crafting
Zarthurians are the masters of temporary technology. For them, everything is impermanent: from the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Weapons/Weapons\|weapons]] they wield to the very land they live on. To them, to live is to prepare for the day where the technology you hold will fail you and you will be left without. This makes each Zarthurian extraordinary self sufficient-- much more so than your average citizen. 

Zarthurian weaponry and armor exemplify this aspect of their culture. For instance, a Zarthurian weapon may be made of a giant monster bone, with poison still coursing through the blade, or a Zarthurian chest plate may have a ceramic plate designed to be shattered by the user to quickly escape from the weighty armor when dexterity is needed. 

## Alchemy & Medicine
Due to the nature of their environment and their lifestyle, Zarthurians are some of the only people in the world with standards for medical sanitation and truly safe practices for handling both medicine and poison alike.
