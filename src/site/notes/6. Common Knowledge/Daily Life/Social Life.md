# Social Life

Zarthurians are generally assumed to be just like their leader: dark, cruel, reclusive and mysterious. In reality, they are much more complicated than that. Borderline-obsessed with personal freedom and achievement, Zarthurians are a proud and protective people who actively trust in survival of the fittest. Freedom is a common goal amongst Zarthurans that may only be rivaled with the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Rioja\|Riojan]] spirit.

For a Zarthurian, everyone has something meaningful to contribute-- and the only way that this world can be survived is if everyone is at their absolute best. To a Zarthurian, this means that beggars are looked upon even more unfavorably than in most places, but also have more genuine means for upward social mobility. After all, if all you have to your name is a fire in your gut, a strong oath and a firm resolve-- nowhere in the world will it go further than in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]].

## Friendship


## Courtship


## Family Life
Zarthurian family structure is largely individualistic and highly varied. Same sex and single parents are much more common here than anywhere else in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. This is due to a culture where all forms of sexuality and gender identity are freely and openly expressed and adoption is entirely without stigma, so parents who do not feel ready for children are much more willing to allow their child go to a good family to receive proper nurturing. 

To a Zarthurian, it is criminal to stand in the way of a childâ€™s dream, and they generally believe that every single person has something special in them. As such, Zarthurian parents often become specialized in one field, but may end up learning many new disciplines alongside their child as they explore their own talents. It is not uncommon to see adults sitting in on a finger painting class and laughing alongside their son or daughter, and it is a moment of pride and happiness when a child overcomes their parent in their passion.

## Nobility
The Zarthurian lust for freedom is even exemplified in the highest honors and houses in Zarthura. Many [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] can proudly trace their lineage back to an escaped prisoner from [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]]. To many societies it would seem horrifying to trace a lineage back to a criminal, but to a Zarthurian, the desire for freedom and company is a right of all. This makes Zarthurian society welcoming to those that manage to survive the trials of escaping from [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]]. Those that prove themselves with survival, and then integration and contribution in Zarthurian society, are often heralded as heroes and some tales are passed down through generations.
