# Crown Contest

Under normal circumstances, every six years there is a competition called the [[6. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] held between each of the members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]. Most of the details about the nature of this competition is highly classified, but it is publicly known that collecting vast amounts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] within their [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Artifacts/Aether Core\|aether core]] can give a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] a huge advantage, and that a great deal of their stored [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] is either lost or spent over the course of the contest. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] are required to participate in the [[6. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], though an archaic loophole in the law does allow for a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] to appoint a substitute to compete in their place; this provision has very rarely been used, and is generally seen as an act of selfishness or surrender. At the conclusion of the [[6. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], a winner is chosen. This individual becomes known the new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]], or the heir apparent to the Zarthurian throne.
