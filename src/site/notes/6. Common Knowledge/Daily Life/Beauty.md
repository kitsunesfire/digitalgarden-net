# Beauty

Zarthurians-- in particular, the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] native to this place-- are generally thought of as inherently beautiful and graceful. This beauty isn't just aesthetic; Zarthurians believe it is a source of strength, sustenance, and a means of resisting evil. Physical beauty is highly prized as a means of social strength, and artistic beauty is coveted, collected, and cherished by all who live here.
