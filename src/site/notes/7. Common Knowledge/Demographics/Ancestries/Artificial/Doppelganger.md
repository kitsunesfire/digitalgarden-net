Though a doppelganger generally resembles a member of a common [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|ancestry]], their distinctive eyes-- each a different color-- set them apart. While not everyone with heterochromia is a doppelganger, all doppelgangers do have this distinctive quality, which often makes it hard for them to hide their nature. 

As they become adults, they may develop other unusual traits related to their manifestation, including rare and supernatural abilities; darkvision innate magic are the most common, but stranger abilities have been known to arise.
