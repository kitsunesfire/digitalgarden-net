[Dwarves](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=1) are gruff, resilient craftsmen of no equal.  They have a well-earned reputation as stoic and stern people who have historically ensconced themselves within citadels and cities carved from solid rock. While some see them as dour, humorless crafters of stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger they may seem untrusting, but friends and family know dwarves to be warm, caring, and unflinchingly selfless. 

Dwarves are generally slow to trust those outside their kin, but this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long history of forced exile from their ancestral holds and of struggles against the horrors that dwell beneath the surface-- especially [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]]. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.

The ancient surface empire that dwarven ancestors are said to have once ruled fell long ago, overwhelmed by forces of darkness and terrible beasts. Today's dwarves retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in those ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with friends and family. 

Nearly all dwarven people share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share a deep hatred and fear of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|mana]], which they believe to be attracting the attentions of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]]. 

## Setting Notes

- Dwarves are common everywhere, but the largest dwarven communities are in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Oyczyzna Podgora]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]], and the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]]. 
- Most dwarves of Sharum Mal'Kari call [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Oyczyzna Podgora]] home, even if they’ve never been there before.
- [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Weapons/Clan Daggers\|Clan Daggers]] do exist in Sharum Mal'Kari, but instead are associated with the culture of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]], not with the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Dwarf\|Dwarf]] ancestry.
- Dwarves in Sharum Mal'Kari have only moderately longer lifespans as compared to humans. As such, any feat that references multi-generational age, knowledge, or experience has either been reflavored or removed.
