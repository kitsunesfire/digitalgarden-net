The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] are also known as [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|sun elves]]. [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] usually have copper, blond or white hair, and their metallic eyes give an impression of being molten. The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] are also frequently blessed with pale or golden wings, which they either display proudly or conceal magically as the need arises. 

Haughty and arrogant, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] generally feel themselves superior to all others-- even the other [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elves]]. They are slow to smile, quick to disparage, and always ready to demonstrate their peerless knowledge and skill. Most [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] could be described as conservative, deliberate, and proud, with a reputation for being considerably more powerful but far less durable than other Zarthurians.

[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above all else. Their long history of brutally exacting revenge for their fallen [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Legionary\|legionnaires ]]and family members have painted them as "radiant [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]]" in the eyes of their neighbors-- especially the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Amira\|Amira]], who view them as ruthless and overly rigid. In contrast to this reputation, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] boast a vibrant spiritual and compassionate culture that is rarely seen outside of their gilded citadels. 

The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] tend to be highly capable fighters, as their society rewards military prowess. As a general rule, they are especially likely to study [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|reiki]], and more often than not possess a natural talent for the divine. The upper ranks of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Surian]] society tend to be made up of generals and priests, and the surest way to improve ones standing is to either impress in the gladiatorial arena of [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Gaelira/Gaelira\|Gaelira]] or to devote oneself to the cloisters of [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Ari Serin/Ari Serin\|Ari Serin]].

Though there are exceptions, [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Surians]] are generally far less motivated to become adventurers than most, and tend to prefer to keep to themselves within the confines of their elaborately constructed settlements. After all, their ancient, highly fortified cities are the stuff legends like [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Aten-Ra/Aten-Ra\|Aten-Ra]] are made of, with their tremendous history, beauty and cultural significance spoken of across the realms-- they have little incentive to leave such lavish homes, especially when what surrounds them is the inhospitable hellscape of the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]].
