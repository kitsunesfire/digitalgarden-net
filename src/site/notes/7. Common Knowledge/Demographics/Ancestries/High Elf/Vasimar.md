[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]], or "[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|light elves]]", are native to the [[4. Gazetteer/Gaean Heartlands/Gaean Heartlands\|Gaean Heartlands]] of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have historically had a reputation for generally staying out of-- or, perhaps more accurately, being *kept* out of-- [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthurian]] politics. They are best known for their adherence to the "old ways": specifically, the ancient [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|somatic]] traditions of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]]. They are commonly seen as healers and guardians, though their reluctance to adopt new [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Imperialist\|Imperialist]] technologies and policies within their territories have gradually made them into enemies of [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]] and harmed their reputation as a result. 

Most [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have a pale complexion, with either silver or white hair. It is common for [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] to have fine line tattoos, especially on their face and torso, and some [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] may have especially long ears. [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] usually have either light green or pale blue eyes, though soft grey or light brown eyes are also fairly common. In the lands outside of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are by far the most common type of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elf]]. 

Many of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are local idol priests, who see divinity not only in the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] but in all things, and see a divine force at work in the universe as a whole. As a people they are taught to believe that the world itself has a sentience and sapience of its own, which they refer to as [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Mona'din\|Mona'din]]. They deeply revere all aspects of life, death, and rebirth as a means of honoring this [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Mona'din\|Goddess Who Slumbers Within]]. In their work and in their worship they present themselves as "humble gardeners" who meticulously and fervently tend to the Blessed Domain of their Goddess. They believe they have been charged with maintaining her Glorious and Most Generous creations-- and been blessed with the means to do so.  

Each of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] channel the power of the universe in a different way, usually through worship of a particular idol, holy site, or local [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|deity]]. They do not generally believe that their [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Mona'din\|Goddess]] has any particular "agenda", so they most often strive for balance and moderation, both for themselves and the world around them. This attitude often led them to take the role of mediators in olden times, but nowadays it is far less common for the populace to seek the counsel of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]], often preferring the more immediate and dramatic results that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] can provide.

Ever since it was founded, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have vehemently and vocally opposed the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Church of the Celestine]]. It is their belief that the ancient rituals that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] have revived should have stayed forgotten, and that their practices actively bring harm to [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Mona'din\|Mona'din]]. However, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are seen as old-fashioned, out of touch, and increasingly irrelevant, which means that their complaints typically fall on deaf ears.
