Ever since [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] have been minority amongst [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elves]], making up only about ten percent of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elven]] population. They have a unique [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|language]] and, unlike the other [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elves]], have a long history of using [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia\|Materia]]. Having lost their ancestral homeland in the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]] during [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], they are somewhat scattered across the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] with minor strongholds established in the [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale of Twilight]] and the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]]. Their largest and most notable settlement, however, is [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Kaer Luthis/Kaer Luthis\|Kaer Luthis]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]]. 

[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] typically have a dark complexion and either white or silver hair. They frequently have golden eyes, though some [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] (particularly those who are born under a [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Blood Moon\|Blood Moon]]) may have red eyes instead. Historically, red eyes were celebrated as a sign of great strength, as many [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] nobles and [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarchs]] had this distinctive feature. However, ever since the long and cruel reign of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Wolfram von Durchenwald\|Wolfram von Durchenwald]], a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]], red eyes have been viewed as an ill omen-- something to be hidden and feared. 

Compared to others, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] are known to be considerably intelligent and particularly ruthless, as having an analytical mindset and being observant at all times is thought to be needed to survive in their society. After all, intellect, along with constitution, are among the traits that have been ruthlessly selected for in their socially Darwinian culture over several generations. 

The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] are elite craftsmen who specialize in working with exotic and esoteric materials. They are famed for their technical ability, which is said to exceed that of any other living [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|ancestry]]. Patient and deliberate in all that they do, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] are particularly famous for the quality of their work and their capacity to temper even the most delicate and volatile substances, especially where rare metals and magical products such as [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia\|Materia]] are concerned. As a result, they have been responsible for the creation of a wide array of legendary weapons and artifacts, and have built mighty reliquaries to house these treasures.

Due largely to their own propensity for scientific experimentation, [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] have developed a higher than normal tolerance for most poisons and a resistance to certain magics. In particular, they have been noted to have innate defenses against most sleep poisons, insect venoms, magical methods of hypnosis, and mental control spells. When they fight, they traditionally wield highly agile, finessed weaponry and prefer to use ambush tactics; those who fight them and live to tell the tale compare it to fighting living darkness. Only their most elite fighters are trusted with the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] signature weapons: the butterfly swords, a paired set of mithril blades infamous for their lethal precision.
