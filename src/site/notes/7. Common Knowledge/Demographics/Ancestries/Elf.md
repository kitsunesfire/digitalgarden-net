[Elves](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=2) combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. To some, elves are objects of awe-- graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to such ideals. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most other ancestries find excessive. 

Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. The nature of this attunement is a mystery, but it appears to be purely instinctive-- a remnant of some long-forgotten tradition, baked into their physiology. It has the side effect of often making them feel connections more deeply than most, often causing great emotional (and sometimes even physical) pain when these bonds are broken.

Owing to this environmental attunement and the tendency to stay in one place for multiple generations (or longer), elves tend to take on physical characteristics that reflect their environment. This is especially true for the elves of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]], who tend to have woodland features, and the elves of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], which tend to have celestial features. 

## Setting Notes

- Elves are common everywhere, but the largest elven communities are in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithran]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Gath\|Gath]], and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. 
- [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]], an elven nation, is the only region in Sharum Mal'Kari that is almost entirely ancestrally homogenous. As such, any character from [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]] is almost guaranteed to have the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|Elf]] ancestry. 
- The Ancient Elf heritage has been reflavored to be associated with vampirism.
- New Elf variants ([[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|High Elf]], [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Suria\|Suria]] and [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Amira\|Amira]]) have been added to this setting 
- Elves in Sharum Mal'Kari (typically) have only moderately longer lifespans as compared to humans. As such, any feat that references multi-generational age, knowledge, or experience has either been reflavored or removed.
