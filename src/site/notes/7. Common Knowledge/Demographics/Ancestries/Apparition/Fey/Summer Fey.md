[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] are lithe and light on their feet, equally built for dancing across the sand and swimming through the water. All [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] tend to prefer gowns, tunics, and capes in the bright colors of seashells and desert flowers. [[7.

The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] enjoy their lives; everything is a source of pleasure to them, from songs and dances to hunts and battles.

Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] fear boredom, and go to great lengths to find new ways to amuse themselves.

The [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] often keep pets. With their charms, they have pacified creatures that are usually wild and violent-- the more curious or exotic the specimen, the better. [[7.

While they are in love, however, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] are fiercely protective of the object of their affections.

[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Summer Fey\|Summer Fey]] dislike being angry, and generally feel dirty when they come out of a rage. They cannot suppress their own spontaneity, however, whether it manifests in joy or in fury.
