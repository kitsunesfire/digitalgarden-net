[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|Malaks]] are entities that are elemental in nature and are native to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]]. They are specialists of a particular kind of magic called [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Artes]], which channel energy from the [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]]. There are eight types of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Malak Artes]]: [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], and [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]]. 

There are nearly infinite different forms a malak might take. As embodiments of the various elemental energies of the cosmos, malaks are frequently viewed as forces of both creation and destruction. Most malaks like to live in places of nature, where the natural flow of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] is strong and can be accessed more freely. Furthermore, they also tend to exhibit a preference for terrain that suits their chosen [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Arte]], such as a fire malak choosing to live near a volcano, an air malak living atop a mountain, or a water malak living on an island or oasis.

While all beings with [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] may at least some minor affinity to at least one of the eight [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Malak Artes]], beings with an unusually high affinity, or “[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]]”, are capable of forging powerful bonds with malaks of that same [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|arte]]. These bonds, often called “[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]]”, are potent exchanges of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] that can result in a wide variety of effects, including but not limited to enhanced strength, elemental defenses, magical capabilities, increased mobility, and an extended lifespan. Most malaks prefer to live independently, but some may choose to form a pact with a mortal. While most [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] that are formed are done so willingly, there are some who force malaks to forge [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]], subjecting them to a long lifetime of servitude—for no matter the nature of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|pact]], the only way to break it is through death.
