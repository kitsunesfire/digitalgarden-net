# Orc Lineage

Understood as savage reflections of divine beings, some of that brutal beauty still resonates within you. You gain the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Orc\|orc]] trait. You can select from [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Orc\|orc]] feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
