# Elven Lineage

Within you flows the blood of the wanderer, wild and untamed. Far more at home in the wilderness, you find new applications for the purposes your ancestors were created. You gain the elf trait, the half-elf trait, and [low-light vision](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=416). In addition, you can select elf, half-elf, and human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
