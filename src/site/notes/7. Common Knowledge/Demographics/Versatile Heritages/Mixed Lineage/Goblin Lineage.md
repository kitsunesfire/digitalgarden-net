# Goblin Lineage

The lust for battle beats hot within you, and your lineage ensures that you are well suited to taking down larger enemies with the skill and the weight of numbers. You gain the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Goblin\|goblin]] trait. You can select from [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Goblin\|goblin]] feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
