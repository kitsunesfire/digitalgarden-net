One of the more common varieties of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|darkspawn]], ghouls are assumed to be the result of humanoid creatures succumbing to [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]]. Many believe that they are what happens to a body that has not received its proper funerial rites, driving a variety of superstitious practices to be performed over fallen foes and allies alike. 

Also commonly known as "draugr", especially in the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]].
