[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|Wraith]] are [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] that result from [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]], or the spirits of the dead who stay in the living world instead of departing to [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]]. Consumed by sadness and rage, they are often twisted reflections of the person they were in life, ranging from an embodiment of their greatest desire to an appearance reflecting a misdeed. There are also [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|wraiths]] who seemingly come into existence without having been alive to begin with, suggesting that there may be other causes for a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|wraith]] to take form.
