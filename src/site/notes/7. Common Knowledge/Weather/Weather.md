# Weather

Each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] is subjected to its own [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Weather\|weather]] patterns, with the [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Weather\|weather]] potentially shifting roughly every eight hours-- at midnight, 8:00 AM, or 4:00 PM. In addition to naturally occurring weather, there are several [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Supernatural Phenomena\|special weather conditions]] that only appear in certain areas or under specific circumstances. 

Local weather is more than just set dressing to establish mood-- it has mechanical effects than can combine with environmental components to add challenge and complexity to a scene. There are many weather conditions which may impose circumstance penalties on certain checks, ranging from a -1 to a -4 based on severity. Some examples include:

- Fog 
- Rain 
- Dust storms
- Snowfall 
- Thunderstorms 
- Extreme temperatures
- Wind
