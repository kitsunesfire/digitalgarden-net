# Lunar Fog

[[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] is an environmental hazard that naturally occurs in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]-- especially within the territories of the [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Lunar Highlands\|Lunar Highlands]] and the [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale of Twilight]]. [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] in and of itself isn't terribly dangerous, but prolonged or concentrated exposure to [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] can lead to contracting the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]]. 

### Visibility
As with normal fog, [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] imposes a circumstance penalty to visual Perception checks, depending on the thickness. 

### Fatigue 
Exposure to [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] causes most creatures to experience discomfort and fatigue, reducing the time it takes for characters to become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Fatigued\|Fatigued]] from overland travel to only 4 hours. 

### Temperature 
[[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] causes the environment to feel colder than usual. Characters treat the temperature of areas within [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] as one step colder than normal (mild to severe, severe to extreme; see [temperature chart](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2768) for details). Appropriate cold-weather gear can negate this effect. 

### Blossoming Curse
One of the known methods of contracting the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] is a result of regular overexposure to [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]]. Any creature who has spent more than 1 month in an environment saturated with [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] must make a save against becoming afflicted with the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]]; your GM may ask you to make this check sooner if your circumstances would meaningfully increase your risk.
