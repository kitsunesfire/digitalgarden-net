# Family Structure

Zarthurian family structure is largely individualistic and highly varied. Same sex and single parents are much more common here than anywhere else in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. This is due to a culture where all forms of sexuality and gender identity are freely and openly expressed and adoption is entirely without stigma, so parents who do not feel ready for children are much more willing to allow their child go to a good family to receive proper nurturing. 

To a Zarthurian, it is criminal to stand in the way of a childâ€™s dream, and they generally believe that every single person has something special in them. As such, Zarthurian parents often become specialized in one field, but may end up learning many new disciplines alongside their child as they explore their own talents. It is not uncommon to see adults sitting in on a finger painting class and laughing alongside their son or daughter, and it is a moment of pride and happiness when a child overcomes their parent in their passion.
