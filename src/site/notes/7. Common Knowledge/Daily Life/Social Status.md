# Social Status



## Nobility
The Zarthurian lust for freedom is even exemplified in the highest honors and houses in Zarthura. Many [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] can proudly trace their lineage back to an escaped prisoner from [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]]. To many societies it would seem horrifying to trace a lineage back to a criminal, but to a Zarthurian, the desire for freedom and company is a right of all. This makes Zarthurian society welcoming to those that manage to survive the trials of escaping from [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]]. Those that prove themselves with survival, and then integration and contribution in Zarthurian society, are often heralded as heroes and some tales are passed down through generations.
