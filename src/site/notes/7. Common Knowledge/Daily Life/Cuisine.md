A variety of spices and herbs can be added for flavor, though the former are typically expensive imports that can only be purchased with [[7. Common Knowledge/Currency/Special Currency/Gil\|Gil]] and therefore confined to the tables of the truly wealthy. Meats are often preserved by salting, and fruits such as dates or raisins are commonly dried for long-term storage. Honey is the primary sweetener, but rather expensive; the cheaper alternative is usually either dates or figs. 

The biggest staples for Zarthurian cuisine are bread, lentils, rice, and beer. Bread and beer are usually prepared in the same location, as the yeast used for bread is also used for brewing. The two are prepared either in special bakeries or, more often, at home, with any surplus sold at a local market. While red wine is a classic Zarthurian signature product and a very popular beverage of choice, its status as a [[7.
