# Aquatic

Oceans, seas, lakes, and other large waterways are aquatic environments. A subset of aquatic environments, undersea environments are those areas submerged beneath the waves.

**Terrain** typically requires a boat or a swim speed; depends on the strengths of currents and the weather  
**Resources** seafood, coral, pearls, shipwrecks  
**Secrets** remote islands filled with monsters, isolated communities, pirates, flooded or underwater cities of aquatic creatures

## Aquatic Geomancy 

Rivers course, tides ebb and flow, and water shifts from ice to vapor, all while creatures grow and adapt within the depths. Casting spells in water calls for a free flow of ideas and emotions. Geomantic rituals intended to change one thing to another often take place in aquatic terrain, or in a liminal space between aquatic terrain and another type of terrain, such as a beach.
