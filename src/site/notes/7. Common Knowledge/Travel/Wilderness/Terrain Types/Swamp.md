# Swamp

Wide floodplains, shallow lakes, and marshes can appear at most latitudes.

**Terrain** typically greater difficult terrain  
**Resources** materials useful for medicine or poison  
**Secrets** river raider camps, remains and gear of unlucky travelers, sites of mystic significance

## Swamp Geomancy 

Wetlands cultivate teeming life, though many of the organisms that thrive in swamps can also bring disease. Marshes, bogs, and fens have their own slightly different geomantic properties, but all envelop the geomancer, engulfing the self in gripping mud, murky water, and calls of buzzing insects. The magic of death and rebirth flourishes in the duality of the swamp.
