# Resting

Characters require 8 hours of sleep each day. Though [[7. Common Knowledge/Travel/Resting/Resting\|Resting]] typically happens at night, a group gains the same benefits for resting during the day. Either way, they can gain the benefits of [[7. Common Knowledge/Travel/Resting/Resting\|Resting]] only once every 24 hours. A character who rests for 8 hours recovers in the following ways:

- The character regains Hit Points equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by their level. If they rest without any shelter or comfort, this healing is reduced by half (to a minimum of 1). 
- The character loses the [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Fatigued\|Fatigued]] condition.
- The character reduces the severity of the [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Death and Dying Conditions/Doomed\|Doomed]] and [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Lowered Abilities/Drained\|Drained]] conditions by 1.
- Most spellcasters need to rest before they regain their spells for the day.

A group in [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode can attempt to rest, but they aren’t entirely safe from danger, and their rest might be interrupted. To mitigate these risks, most parties will choose to[[7. Common Knowledge/Travel/Resting/Watches and Rest\| keep watch]] over each other while they rest. The 8 hours of rest do not need to be consecutive, however, and after an interruption, characters can go back to sleep.  
  
Sleeping in armor results in poor rest and causes a character to wake up [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Fatigued\|Fatigued]]. If a character would have recovered from fatigue, sleeping in armor prevents it.  
  
If a character goes more than 16 hours without going to sleep, they become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Fatigued\|Fatigued]].  
  
Taking long-term rest for faster recovery is part of the [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Relax\|Relax]] activity, which can only be selected during [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]].
