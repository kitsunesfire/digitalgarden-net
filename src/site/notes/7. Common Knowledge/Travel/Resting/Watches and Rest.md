# Watches and Rest

Adventuring parties usually put a few people on guard to watch out for danger while the others rest. Spending time on watch also interrupts sleep, so a night’s schedule needs to account for everyone’s time on guard duty. The table below indicates how long the group needs to set aside for rest, assuming everyone gets a rotating watch assignment of equal length.

| Party Size | Total Time           | Duration of Each Watch |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2          | 16 hours             | 8 hours                |
| 3          | 12 hours             | 4 hours                |
| 4          | 10 hours, 40 minutes | 2 hours, 40 minutes    |
| 5          | 10 hours             | 2 hours                |
| 6          | 9 hours, 36 minutes  | 1 hour, 36 minutes     |
| 7          | 9 hours, 20 minutes  | 1 hour, 20 minutes     |
| 8          | 9 hours, 9 minutes   | 1 hour, 9 minutes      |
| 9+         | 9 hours              | 1 hour                 |
