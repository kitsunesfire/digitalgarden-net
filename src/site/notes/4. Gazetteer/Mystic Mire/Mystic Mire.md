# The Mystic Mire

Most of the residents of the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]] see themselves as "true Zarthurian loyalists", often descended from (unsuccessful) rebels who opposed the formation of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. Some of these scrappy fighters have not acknowledged the legitimacy of any Zarthurian ruler since the reign of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Val'Drah\|Val'Drah]], and even now-- after hundreds of years-- there are many who await her rightful return. 

Though the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]] does have a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] to represent them (just like any other [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Province]]), in this region, the title is seen as symbolic *at best* and does not confer any additional influence or status. This disdain and disregard has typically cut both ways, with the leadership in [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]] tending to completely ignore the plights of the Mirelands and the dangers found within. Some say that ever since the capital was moved away from [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Surrse Kasteel/Surrse Kasteel\|Surrse Kasteel]], the Mirelands have been treated as completely irrelevant to the rest of the Empire. Others say it is the product of personal grudges held over centuries and generations, where the noble houses of the other [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] have never really ever forgiven or forgotten Queen [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Val'Drah\|Val'Drah]]'s sudden and inexplicable abandonment. Others still suspect the underlying source of the tension to be far more recent, and likely connected with the recent failed attempt at rebellion that resulted in [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Silas\|Silas Braska]]'s subsequent rise to power. Whatever the source, most of the commoners here generally believe that even if the entirety of the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]] were to erupt, disappear, or be wiped off the planes of existence, [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]] would almost certainly just look the other way and carry on with their normal governance. 

...Honestly, they might be right.
