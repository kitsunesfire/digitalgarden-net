# Red Wastes

In a continent full of hazardous environments, the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]] still are far and away the most deadly. Though the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]] work diligently to keep the [[Chthonic Gates\|Chthonic Gate]] closed as much as possible for as long as possible, it is still not a perfect seal; even in the best of times, harmful magical energies continue to incessantly radiate out and influence both the terrain in the area and the lifeforms that call this region home. 

Every so often, the forces on the other side of the portal manage to overwhelm the seal and break through, flooding the Wastes with fonts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] and dangerous, otherworldly creatures of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]. These occurrences are referred to as the "[[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Void Effects/Dark Sun\|Dark Sun]]", since the powers of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] are often so strong that they obscure (or sometimes completely block) all sunlight. Whenever this happens, it is standard practice to take shelter within the cavernous ruins dotted about the Wastes (or flee the region, if possible) and wait until the area has been secured by the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] and the land "[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Cleansing\|Cleansed]]" by the healing rites of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]].
