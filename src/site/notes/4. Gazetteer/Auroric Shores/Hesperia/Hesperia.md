# Hesperia

> [!info]+ Overview
> An elaborate citadel where alliances are forged through a combination of discourse, wine, and entertainment.

[[4. Gazetteer/Auroric Shores/Hesperia/Hesperia\|Hesperia]] is a place that is mostly famous for hosting a variety of pleasure palaces, gardens, and games. Nobles, notables and dignitaries from throughout the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] and its neighboring realms regularly pass in and out through [[4. Gazetteer/Auroric Shores/Hesperia/Hesperia\|Hesperia]]'s jeweled harbor, with giant pleasure barges mooring or lazily circling the island. Each ship is unique, and many are designed in tribute to the nature and environs of a specific region.
