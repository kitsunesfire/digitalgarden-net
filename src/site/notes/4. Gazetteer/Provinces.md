# Provinces

Under the Zarthurian monarchy, each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] is governed by a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]]. While the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] are expected to uphold the law of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|crown]], they are granted a large degree of autonomy over how they rule over their territory. For instance, even though, *officially*, only the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] has the right to make new laws or to change existing ones, it has been common in Zarthurian history for [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] to create and enforce provincial laws of their own without the involvement (or even direct approval) of the capital. Therefore, while some aspects of Zarthurian culture and custom remain universal, each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] has over time developed its own distinct sub-culture.

At present, there are 9 provinces that make up the territories held by the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. Each province is governed by a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]], who in turn receives directives and commands from the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. These nine provinces are called the:
