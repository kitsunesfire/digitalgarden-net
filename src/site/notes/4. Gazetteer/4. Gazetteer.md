# 4. Gazetteer

The [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] is located in the far south east of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], with the closest trade partners being the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/United Altos Isles\|United Altos Isles]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Camboragh\|Camboragh]], [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]] and The [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]]. The continent of Zarthura has always been mostly isolated from the rest of the world, with their waters nearly constantly churning with [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Corsairs/Corsairs\|Corsairs]] and various monsters of the deep, making travel and trade a venture only for the truly brave-- or desperate.  

Local Zarthurians are perpetually reminded that they reside in the lingering shadow of their once-magnificent history. Throughout Zarthura's landscape, remnants of the past are abound. In some [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]], the local traditions and climate have allowed for time to more-or-less stand still, with these ancient constructions of times long-gone still remarkably well-preserved and functional. In others, the elements, customs, or mechanizations of fate have not been quite so generous and have left little more than a scattering of crumbling ruins that can only be spotted by a knowing eye or stumbled upon after a long day's journey well off the beaten path. 

The settled portions of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] are primarily made up of small towns and villages, where intrepid travelers can elect to withstand the dangers of the hostile wilderness in exchange for the chance to start anew. The diversity found within these settlements contrasts starkly with the secretive cities of the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elven]] natives, who more often than not close their doors to outsiders (save for occasional trade deals, diplomatic convoys, or entertainment).
