# Forum Virenti

> [!info]+ Overview
> A sprawling open-air marketplace, where business is conducted night or day, rain or shine

Constant changes to the layout of [[4. Gazetteer/Gaean Heartlands/Forum Virenti/Forum Virenti\|Forum Virenti]] make it a confusing place to shop for those unaccustomed to its methods. However, there are a few lanes, walkways, and landmarks that remain permanent fixtures, and have likely existed since the beginnings of civilization on the Zarthurian continent. Many well-established merchant houses, mystics, and caravans have conducted business here for generations. Trade at the Forum is conducted at all hours and in all weather, despite most of the area being outdoors; this is aided by special lamps and umbrellas which can be purchased for a premium. 

Nearly anything can be purchased or traded for at [[4. Gazetteer/Gaean Heartlands/Forum Virenti/Forum Virenti\|Forum Virenti]], but the main problem is actually finding specific items. In order to save time, some choose to hire guides or porters to show them where specific vendors can be found or carry their wares back to their carts. Services such as porters, guides, torch-bearers, and bodyguards are all regularly available in the Forum, for a fee.
