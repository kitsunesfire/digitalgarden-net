# Vale of Twilight

The [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale of Twilight]] is covered with dells with silver birch trees and winding streams, blanketed with pale grasses and wildflowers. Its trees are taller and more majestic than those of the neighboring [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Valley]], with very little undergrowth save for the occasional thicket of thorns. Phosphorescent lichens grown on the silver-trunked trees, and no matter the time of day or year, the air of the [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale]] tends to be foggy and cool. The sky in the distance above the crowns of the trees is a perpetual pearl-gray, and it seems as if there is no east or west, for the same source-less illumination lights the horizon no matter in what direction one looks. Near the sky's zenith, however, the skies are the purple velvet of true night and are filled with preternaturally brilliant stars. During the "night", the sky darkens into pure blackness. 

At the borders of the [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale]], the forests grow thicker and thicker, and any track one follows or makes appears to simply bend back upon itself. The only reliable way through this misty maze is to traverse through one of the stone arches which serve as gateways to and from the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]]. Of these, the commonly utilized is the one in [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Ravensgate/Ravensgate\|Ravensgate]]-- made famous as the best place to buy and sell mithril. 

The [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale of Twilight]] is a relatively quiet place. There are a few animals that frequently appear along the roads, such as white owls, silver-gray deer, black squirrels, large gray-furred bears, and jewel-toned dragonflies, but as long as travelers keep to the established pathways they are unlikely to run into much trouble. The dangers of the the [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vale of Twilight\|Vale]] lie within the sluggish, silver-grey mists of the deep forests-- areas where the starlight blinks out and the skies are pitch black. Here, horrific aberrations are known to thrive, and untold horrors are made real.
