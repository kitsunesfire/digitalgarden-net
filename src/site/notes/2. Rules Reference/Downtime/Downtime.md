# Downtime

It is possible for some campaigns to start at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a matter of months of in-game time. Though that pace works well for many campaigns, most stories set in Sharum Mal'Kari have pauses built into them—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. By engaging in [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]], the campaign takes on a longer timeline—one in which events in the world play out over years. Wars begin and end, tyrants come and go, and royal lines rise and fall, all over the course of the story that you are telling. 

Sometimes, [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] may happen away from the game table. For example, players may be asked to pick their [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]] at the end of a session, and then the GM will communicate the results either over Discord or at the beginning of the next session.

## Time Scale 

[[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] is a "fast-forward" mode, where a single chosen activity takes a day or more of in-game time to complete. Most downtime periods can be measured in days or weeks, but some longer downtime periods could take months-- or even years.
