# Philander
#Downtime 

You may spend your downtime engaged in a variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, binge drinking, flirting, or anything else that helps you cope with the perils you face on your adventures. 

A philandering character spends money as though maintaining a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Wealthy\|Wealthy]] lifestyle. At the end of the period spent philandering, you roll a skill check related to the nature of your activities (usually [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]]). 

**Critical Success**: As success, but you also earn one additional award of your choosing. 
**Success**: Your downtime is a blur, but you remember having a good time. You earn one reward from the table below, of your GM's choosing.
**Failure**: Your downtime is a blur; you can't remember anything significant happening. You suffer one consequence from the table below, of the GM's choosing.
**Critical Failure**: As failure, but the GM chooses two consequences.
