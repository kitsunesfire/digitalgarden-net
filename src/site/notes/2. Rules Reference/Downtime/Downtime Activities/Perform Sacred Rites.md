# Perform Sacred Rites
#Downtime 

A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a [[7. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Faith\|deity]] he or she reveres. In between rites, the character spends time in meditation and prayer. A character who is a priest in the temple can lead these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, consecrations, and ordinations. A layperson can perform more simple tasks, such as offering sacrifices in a temple, or assisting a priest with a complex ritual.

## Resources

You must be at least Master in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Religion\|Religion]] in order to perform Sacred Rites, and you must be at least Trained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Religion\|Religion]] in order to attempt to assist in these rites. There is no guarantee a layperson's volunteer efforts will be accepted; in some cases, this may require a successful [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]], [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Religion\|Religion]], or relevant [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] Skill check. 

## Resolution

A character who spends at least 2 days performing sacred rites may make a Religion check against a DC of their choice.
