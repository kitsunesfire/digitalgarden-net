# Downtime Activities

[[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] activities are tasks that take all day to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job.

## Choosing Downtime Activities 

Under normal circumstances, you can choose one [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|downtime activity]] for every day of downtime. Your downtime activity should reflect how you would like to be spending the majority of your time, though you are free to also describe how they might be spending some of their free time (when they have the chance). No matter your choice, you will likely still need to pay for your [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Cost of Living\|Cost of Living]]. 

Sometimes, your circumstances may limit the activities you are able to choose. For instance, if you are recovering from an [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Ailments & Injuries\|ailment or injury]], you might only be able to choose to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Relax\|Relax]] for your downtime activity while you recover. Likewise, if you were unable to locate a nearby temple or shrine relevant to your [[6. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Faith\|Faith]] during your [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] of the area, you would not be able to choose to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Perform Sacred Rites\|Perform Sacred Rites]]-- but you could go exploring to see if there were any interesting temples you missed!  

If you would like to spend your downtime in a way that isn't currently reflected in the existing [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities Overview\|activities]], work with your GM to find a solution. 

## Cooperation in Downtime

While may are instances where [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]] are resolved independently, most of the time it is possible for multiple characters to cooperate on the same [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] task. If it is a simple, straightforward task, it might mean one character taking the lead on the task with the other character(s) providing [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Aid\|Aid]]. However, if it is a complex task, this usually means each character is working on different parts of the task collaboratively, necessitating each participant to contribute their own skill check towards the greater success of the activity. 

## Resolving Downtime Activities

The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require checks, so if you are resolving [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] remotely make sure your GM can reference your character's ability scores and skills.

Most downtime activities require at least one full day to complete, though some may require more. In most cases, the days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time-- otherwise your character will encounter extra complications (see below) and may have to pay as much as double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.

## Complications

Some activities include a discussion of complications that may be thrown your way. The consequences of a complication might spawn new side quests, introduce NPCs, or give you headaches or advantages in any number of other ways. For any complication that arises, a GM may roll to determine a complication randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of their own.
