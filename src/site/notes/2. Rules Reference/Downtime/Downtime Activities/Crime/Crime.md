# Crime
#Downtime 

Sometimes, crime does pay. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

## Resources

A character must spend at least 25 sp gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.

## Resolution

The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime. The chosen DC can be easy, standard, difficult, or very difficult. Successful completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces, as shown on the Loot Value table below.

To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: Stealth, Thievery, and the player's choice of Perception, Society, or Deception.

- If none of the checks are successful, the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and/or must spend one week in jail for each 25sp of the fine.
- If only one check is successful, the heist fails but the character escapes; a complication occurs (see below)
- If two checks are successful, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.
- If all three checks are successful, the character earns the full value of the loot.

| DC | Sample Value |
|----|-------|
| Easy | 5 gp, robbery of a standard merchant |
| Standard | 25 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant |
| Difficult | 125 gp, robbery of a noble |
| Very Difficult | 625 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town |{ #loot-value}


## Complications

A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table if you succeeds on only one check. If the character's rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks. A GM may elect to substitute any roll on this table with a complication of their choosing.
