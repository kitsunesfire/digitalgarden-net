# Make a Bribe
#Downtime #Secret 

You offer a bribe to your contact to assist your party in some way. A bribe is money or something else of value offered or given to someone to get them to do something you want them to do, especially something they're not supposed to do. A bribe always costs at least 1/10 of the Currency per Additional PC listed on this [table](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=581). Doubling this amount grants a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. 

To make a bribe, select the target of your bribe and attempt a hard or very hard [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]], [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] check. 

**Success** The contact accepts the bribe and you gain 1 [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Favors\|favor]].  
**Failure** You believe you successfully Bribed your Contact and gained a [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Favors\|favor]], but in fact the contact informs the opposition of the attempted bribery, increasing their [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] . The GM can reveal that this bribe grants no benefit at any point, as befits the story.  
**Critical Failure** As failure, but increasing [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] even more.
