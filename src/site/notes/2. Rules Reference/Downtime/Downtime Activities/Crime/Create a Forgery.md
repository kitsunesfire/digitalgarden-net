# Create a Forgery

Prerequisite: Access to a Writing Set

You must have the proper writing material to create a forgery. When you [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Crime/Create a Forgery\|Create a Forgery]], the GM rolls a secret [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] check. If you succeed, the forgery is of good enough quality that passive observers can’t notice the fake-- only those who carefully examine the document and attempt a Perception or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] check against your Society DC can do so.  
  
If the document’s handwriting doesn’t need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a circumstance bonus to your check. To forge a specific person’s handwriting, you need a sample of that person’s handwriting.  
  
If your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] check fails, the forgery has some obvious signs of being a fake. The GM compares your result to each passive observer’s Perception DC or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] DC, whichever is higher, using the success or failure results below. Once the GM rolls your check for a document, that same result is used against all passive observers’ DCs no matter how many creatures passively observe that document.  
  
An observer who was fooled on a passive glance can still choose to closely scrutinize the documents on the lookout for a forgery, using different techniques and analysis methods beyond the surface elements you successfully forged with your original check. In that case, the observer can attempt a Perception or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] check against your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] DC (if they succeed, they know your document is a forgery).  
  
**Success** The observer does not detect the forgery.  
**Failure** The observer knows your document is a forgery.
