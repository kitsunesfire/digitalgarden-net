# Sow Rumors
#Downtime 

Swaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's standing in a community or embroil someone in scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard to disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, playing off what people want to believe about the person in question.

Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization requires a number of days depending on the size of the community, as shown in the table below. In a town or city, the time spent must be continuous; for example, if the character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on an adventure for another few days, and then returns, the rumor fades away without the benefit of constant repetition.

| Settlement Size | Time Required |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Village | 1d6 days |
| Town | 2d6 days |
| City | 3d6 days |{ #sowing-rumors}


The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover the cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. At the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the character must make a Society check as well as your choice of a Deception or Diplomacy check; these checks are made against a standard DC for your level, but the GM may adjust this. 

If the check succeeds, the community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts one step toward friendly or hostile, as the character wishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, and further attempts to propagate it fail. Shifting a community's general attitude toward a person or organization doesn't necessarily affect everyone in the community-- individuals might still hold to their own opinions, particularly if they have personal experience in dealing with the subject of the rumors.
