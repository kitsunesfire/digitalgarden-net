# Thorough Questioning
#Downtime 

While you can usually use your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] to [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|Gather Information]], you can choose to perform a much more thorough investigation during downtime. 

## Resolution 

You thoroughly converse with several knowledgeable or reliable contacts. You may attempt up to three [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|Gather Information]] checks, each with a +1 circumstance bonus. These checks can be for the same or different topics, and you may expend one of the rolls you haven't used yet to re-attempt a [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|Gather Information]] check you have failed as part of this activity. 

If you are living at a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Wealthy\|Wealthy]] standard of [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Cost of Living\|living]] or higher, you may freely [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|Gather Information]] amongst the nobility. Otherwise, you must succeed a difficult [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] check for your [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Biome DC\|Biome DC]]. 

If you are living at a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Poor\|Poor]] standard of [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Cost of Living\|living]] or lower, you may freely [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|Gather Information]] amongst the destitute. Otherwise, you must succeed a difficult [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] check for your [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Biome DC\|Biome DC]].
