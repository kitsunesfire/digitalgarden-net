# Scout a Location
#Downtime #Secret 

You spend time observing a particular place or group. Attempt a normal, hard, or very hard DC skill check relevant to the location-- usually a Perception, [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]], [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]], or relevant [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] skill check.

**Success** You make helpful observations.  
**Failure** You learn nothing particularly noteworthy.  
**Critical Failure** You misjudge some aspect of what you observed.
