# Subsist
#Downtime 

If you need to provide food and shelter, you can use the Subsist [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|downtime activity]]. This typically uses [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]] if you’re in a settlement or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Survival\|Survival]] if you’re in the wild.

[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Society\|Society]]: Subsist in a settlement by finding shelter, scrounging, or begging for food.  
[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Survival\|Survival]]: Subsist in the wild by foraging for food and building shelter.

You try to provide food and shelter for yourself, and possibly others as well, with a standard of living. The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the place where you're trying to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Subsist\|Subsist]]. You might need a minimum proficiency rank to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Subsist\|Subsist]] in particularly strange environments. Unlike most [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]], you can [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Subsist\|Subsist]] after 8 hours or less of exploration, but if you do, you take a –5 penalty.  
  
**Critical Success** You either provide a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Poor\|Poor]] lifestyle for yourself and one additional creature, or you improve your own food and shelter, granting yourself a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Modest\|Modest]] lifestyle.  
**Success** You find enough food and shelter with basic protection from the elements to provide you a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Poor\|Poor]] lifestyle.  
**Failure** You’re exposed to the elements and don’t get enough food, becoming [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Fatigued\|Fatigued]] until you attain sufficient food and shelter. You have a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Squalid\|Squalid]] lifestyle.  
**Critical Failure** You attract trouble, eat something you shouldn’t, or otherwise worsen your situation. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to checks to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Subsist\|Subsist]] for 1 week. You don’t find any food at all; if you don’t have any stored up, you’re in danger of starving or dying of thirst if you continue failing. You have a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Cost of Living/Squalid\|Squalid]] lifestyle.
