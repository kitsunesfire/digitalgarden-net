# Sell an Uncommon Magic Item
#Downtime 

A character who comes into possession of an ==Uncommon== or ==Rare==  magic item that he or she wants to sell can spend [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] searching for a buyer. This [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|downtime activity]] can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can't typically be sold during [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]], as finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of a side-quest.

Selling a magic item of any rarity is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found. Buyers sometimes procure rare and very rare items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown; characters will not always have the foreknowledge of the identity of their interested buyer before they must decide whether or not to accept their offered bid. 

## Resources

A character can attempt to find a buyer for one uncommon or rare magic item by spending at least 25 sp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale; you may spend more to increase the chances of attracting the attentions of a reputable guild, collector, or otherwise interested party. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.

## Resolution

A character who wants to sell an item must make a Diplomacy check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. 

| Check Total | You Find... |
|------------------|-------------|
| Critical Failure | A buyer offering a tenth of the base price; double the chances of a complication |
| Failure  | A buyer offering a quarter of the base price, and a shady buyer offering half the base price |
| Success | A buyer offering half the base price, and a shady buyer offering the full base price |
| Critical Success | A buyer offering the full base price, and a shady buyer offering one and a half times the base price, no questions asked |{ #magic-item-buyer}


## Complications

The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Some examples of possible complications are included in the table below:

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Your enemy secretly arranges to buy the item to use it against you. |
| 2 | A thieves' guild, alerted to the sale, attempts to steal your item. |
| 3 | A foe circulates rumors that your item is a fake. |
| 4 | A sorcerer claims your item as a birthright and demands you hand it over. |
| 5 | Your item's previous owner, or surviving allies of the owner, vow to retake the item by force. |
| 6 | The buyer is murdered before the sale is finalized. |
