# Buy an Uncommon Magic Item
#Downtime 

Purchasing an  ==Uncommon== or ==Rare== magic item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires. ==Uncommon== and ==Rare==  items are always subject to GM approval, and may not always be available. 

## Resources

Finding ==Uncommon== magic items to purchase requires at least 10 gp in expenses; the monetary cost includes a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential business partners. ==Rare== magic items, when available, typically require at least 50gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a friendly seller. 

## Resolution

A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Society check to determine the quality of the seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and/or a +1 bonus for every additional 10 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +4. 

## Complications

The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains.
