# Earn Income
#Downtime 

You use one of your skills to make money during [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]]. The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative job available; by default, this is a task level equal to your level -2. If you prefer, you can search for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can also attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this takes time and requires using the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] skill to [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Gather Information\|Gather Information]], doing some research, or socializing.

After your first day of work, you roll to determine your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your result, the task’s level, and your proficiency rank (as listed in the table).

You can continue working at the task on subsequent days without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the task’s completion. The GM determines how long you can work at the task. Most tasks can last at least a week or two, though some can be extended for months or even years.

**Critical Success** You do outstanding work. Gain the amount of currency listed for the task level + 1 and your proficiency rank.  
**Success** You do competent work. Gain the amount of currency listed for the task level and your proficiency rank.  
**Failure** You do shoddy work and get paid the bare minimum for your time. Gain the amount of currency listed in the failure column for the task level. The GM will likely reduce how long you can continue at the task.  
**Critical Failure** You earn nothing for your work and are fired immediately. You can’t continue at the task. Your reputation suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find rewarding jobs in that community in the future.

## Earn Income (Faction)

If you have renown within an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild-- and that organization has a meaningful presence in your current settlement-- you may use your connections to get a task from that faction. 

Earning income from faction-related work is the same as the standard [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Commerce/Earn Income\|Earn Income]] activity, except employment from within a faction typically has higher level tasks available and/or lower DCs for success. Characters with high renown in an organization may even qualify for temporary protection from Critical Failures on Earning Income from faction-related work, though repeated failures are likely to tarnish their overall renown and [[2.
