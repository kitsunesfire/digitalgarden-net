# Hunt Monsters
#Downtime 

By utilizing your talents as a hunter, tracker, or your skill as a warrior, this activity gives you the chance to make some extra cash-- or even snag specific monster parts from creatures. 

To hunt monsters, you must spend at least one day finding a contract that is willing to pay you, and also spend some money in preparation for your job. This may include buying special bait, traps, and oils, or securing transportation and/or the services of a guide to a take you to a remote hunting ground. The total expense is determined by the rarity of the creature(s) you are hunting, and may be modified by your circumstances. 

| Quarry                                                                | Biome DC    | Base Preparation Cost |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------- |
| Handful of common creatures, or one specific monster                    | Easy    | 25sp                  |
| Rare creature or monster                                                | Standard    | 5gp                   |
| Dangerous monster or creature(s) in an exotic territory                 | Hard    | 75sp                  |
| Extremely dangerous monster or creature, typically in hazardous terrain | Very Hard    | 10gp                  |{ #monster-hunting-preparation}


## Resolution 

You must make three checks-- one skill, one attack roll, and one of your choosing-- with the DC determined by the [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Biome DC\|Biome DC]], modified by the risks associated with your chosen quarry. For your skill check, you may choose between [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Nature\|Nature]], [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Survival\|Survival]], an appropriate terrain [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] or the recall knowledge skill associated with the type of creature you are hunting. For your attack roll, choose one weapon in your inventory or spell that you are capable of casting and make an attack; you may assume best possible circumstances, and apply situational bonuses as relevant. Your third check may either be an additional skill check with a different skill, or an additional attack roll with a different weapon or spell. The number of successes determines the outcome of the activity:

| Result      | Value                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 successes | The hunt fails and you become injured. You must spend at least 1 additional dayrecovering.                        |
| 1 success   | The hunt fails, but no injuries are sustained.                                                                    |
| 2 successes | The hunt is partially successful, earning you half the payout.                                                    |
| 3 successes | Your hunt was successful. You earn the full value of the payout and may keep a specific monster part as a trophy. |{ #hunting-results}


Successful completion of the contract also yields a reward, as shown in the table below:

## Complications 

Monster hunting can be dangerous, and complications may arise. Any time you fail or critically fail a hunt, you have a 10% chance of triggering a complication. Some examples of common complications include:

| d8  | Complication   |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | You have killed the prized beast of a druid, angering their tribe    |
| 2   | You have killed either the mother or child of a larger, more formidable beast that intends to track you down and slay you in revenge    |
| 3   | One of the mercenaries you hired to help you has died, and their family blames you for their death    |
| 4   | Your monster hunting has angered a local druid, who demands you put a stop to your hunting and pay retributions    |
| 5   | You have gotten the attention of another monster hunter who believes you are problematic competition    |
| 6   | Your failed expedition has put a noble into a predicament where they needed the monster part(s) you failed to gather    |
| 7   | You failed to kill your quarry, instead only injuring them. You have a feeling that you are being watched everywhere you go in the wilds.    |
| 8   | In escaping your quarry, you had to leave your guide behind. You are unsure on whether or not they are alive, but you're aware that they knew you left them behind to die.    |{ #hunting-complications}
