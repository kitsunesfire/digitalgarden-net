# Relax
#Downtime 

Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is simply relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation, or needs to recover from injuries, relaxing is the ideal option for adventurers who just need a break. This option is best suited for players who don't want to make use of the [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] system. If a player does not choose [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] activities for their character, they are assumed to be relaxing. 

## Resources

Characters must maintain at least a modest lifestyle in a secure location in order to benefit from relaxing. 

## Resolution

As long as the character maintains at least a modest lifestyle, they automatically recover from all damage and most nonpermanent conditions. However, characters affected by [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Ailments & Injuries\|Ailments & Injuries]] may need to continue attempting relevant saves during [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]]. 

This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a curse or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration. Likewise, permanent injuries do not automatically end during relaxation. There may be special circumstances which require magic or special care; this cannot be resolved simply by relaxing. 

## Complications

Relaxing very rarely comes with complications, though a GM may determine that certain locations may still attract the attention of potential rivals unless intentional measures are taken to lay low.
