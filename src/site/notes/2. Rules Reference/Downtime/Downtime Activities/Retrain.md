# Retrain
#Downtime 

Retraining offers a way to alter some of your character choices, which is helpful when you want to take your character in a new direction or change decisions that didn’t meet your expectations. You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can’t perform other [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]] while retraining.  
  
Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training, or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you’ll have to pay your instructor. Additionally, some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a Sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).  
  
When retraining, you generally can’t make choices you couldn’t make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can’t exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn’t meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don’t remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can’t use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.

## Retraining Feats 

You can spend a week of [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a Wizard feat.

## Retraining Skills 

You can spend a week of [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] retraining to swap out one of your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|skill]] increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Performance\|Performance]] and [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]], and an expert in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Occultism\|Occultism]], you could reduce the character’s proficiency in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] to expert and become a master in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Occultism\|Occultism]], but you couldn’t reassign that skill increase to become legendary in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Performance\|Performance]]. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.  
  
You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during [[Character Creation\|Character Creation]].

## Retrain Class Features 

You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a Druid order or a Wizard school—always at least a month.
