# Study
#Downtime 

Forewarned is forearmed. The time between adventures is a great chance to study a topic of interest, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Studying can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips. The [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Study/Study\|Study]] [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|downtime activity]] allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

## Resources

Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to study. If these resources are unavailable, you must spend additional time (and possibly purchase supplemental materials) as you pursue independent research. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.

## Resolution

The character declares the focus of their  studyingâ€”a specific person, place, or thing. The GM determines whether the information you seek is available, how many days of [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as a Perception check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Diplomacy check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

After the allotted duration, the character makes a relevant skill check. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains +1 circumstance bonus to this check. Determine how much lore a character learns using the table below.

| Check Result | Outcome |
|-------------|---------|
| Critical Failure | No outcome; double the chance of a complication |
| Failure | No outcome |
| Success | You learn 1 clue  |
| Critical Success | You learn 2 clues  |{ #research-outcomes}


Each clue is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. The GM is the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, they might reveal elements of its statistics or personality. For a location, they might reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

## Complications

The greatest risk in studying is uncovering false information. Not all clues are accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of study is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during studying, examples of which are on the table below.

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | You accidentally damage a rare book. |
| 2 | You offend a sage, who demands an extravagant gift. |
| 3 | If you had known that book was cursed, you never would have opened it. |
| 4 | A sage becomes obsessed with convincing you of a number of strange theories about reality. |
| 5 | Your actions cause you to be banned from a library until you make reparations. |
| 6 | You uncovered useful clues, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return. |
