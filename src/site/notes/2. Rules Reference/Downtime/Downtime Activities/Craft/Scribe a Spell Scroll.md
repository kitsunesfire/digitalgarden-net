# Scribe a Spell Scroll
#Downtime 

With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a spell scroll. You must have the [Magical Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=812) skill feat to create magic items.

## Resources

The process to [craft a scroll](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=724) is much like that to [craft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) any other magic item. When you begin the crafting process, choose a spell to put into the scroll. You have to either Cast that Spell during the crafting process, or someone else must do so in your presence. Casting that spell doesn't produce its normal effects; instead, the magic is trapped inside the scroll. The casting must come from a spellcaster expending a spell slot. You can't [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Craft/Craft\|Craft]] a scroll from a spell produced from another magic item, for example. The caster has to provide any cost of the spell. You need to learn only a single 1st-level formula to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Craft/Craft\|Craft]] scrolls.  
  
Like other consumables, scrolls can be crafted in batches of four. All scrolls of one batch must contain the same spell at the same level, and you must provide one casting for each scroll crafted.

## Complications

Crafting a spell scroll is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complications that arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed for the activity. Some examples of possible complications are included in the table below:

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | You bought up the last of the rare ink used to craft scrolls, angering a wizard in town. |
| 2 | The priest of a temple of good accuses you of trafficking in dark magic. |
| 3 | A wizard eager to collect one of your spells in a book presses you to sell the scroll. |
| 4 | Due to a strange error in creating the scroll, it is instead a random spell of the same level. |
| 5 | The rare parchment you bought for your scroll has a barely visible map on it. |
