# Grow
#Downtime #Manipulate #Rare

In an ancient land, an [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|elf]] plays a haunting melody on a flute among the trees, growing entire buildings seamlessly from still-living wood. Elsewhere, a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Wood/Fungi\|fungi]] [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|malak]] holds a conversation with the mushrooms of an underground cavern, convincing them to twine together into a latticed armor to defend the cavern against a new threat encroaching from the darkness. 

The traditional methods of crafting items tell the story of a crafter retrieving the necessary raw materials and then working those materials via forging, woodworking, tailoring, or other such means; however, this is but one way to create magic items. In places of heightened primal power, such as [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]], the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/United Altos Isles\|United Altos Isles]], or the fey forests of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]], it might make sense to grow an item from a living thing instead. While most of these examples assume a natural environment, they can just as easily occur in a hidden laboratory, where an alchemist might form magical oozes into specific shapes before curing them with magical reagents, producing a sword as durable as any steel. 

Mechanically, the process of growing an item uses the same principles as [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Crafting\|Crafting]] it normally, though the details and the story surrounding its creation process differ. However, as this activity has the ==Rare== trait, it is only available in certain circumstances.
