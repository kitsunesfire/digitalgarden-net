# Cooperation in Downtime

While may are instances where [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Downtime Activities\|Downtime Activities]] are resolved independently, most of the time it is possible for multiple characters to cooperate on the same [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] task. If it is a simple, straightforward task, it might mean one character taking the lead on the task with the other character(s) providing [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Aid\|Aid]]. However, if it is a complex task, this usually means each character is working on different parts of the task collaboratively, necessitating each participant to contribute their own skill check towards the greater success of the activity.
