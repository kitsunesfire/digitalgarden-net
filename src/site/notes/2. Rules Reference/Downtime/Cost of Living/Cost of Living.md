# Cost of Living

Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living over a period of time. It covers your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other daily necessities. Furthermore, these expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls. 

At the start of each week or month, choose a lifestyle from the Cost of Living table. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the resources and connections you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your career-- the choice is yours. 

Keep in mind, your chosen lifestyle can have consequences. For instance, maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, but you will run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally will help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.
