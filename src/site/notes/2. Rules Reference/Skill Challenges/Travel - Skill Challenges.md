# Travel - Skill Challenges

Most of the time, this campaign will treat the simple process of traveling from point A to point B as a [[2. Rules Reference/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|Skill Challenge]] with the following parameters:

- At the outset of the challenge, the party must describe their preparations (if any), any special considerations (ex: *We want to avoid notice as much as possible, so we want to stay away from the main roads*) and their intended pace.
- Under normal circumstances, the party must achieve 4 successes before they reach 3 failures in order to safely arrive at their destination. As with all [[2. Rules Reference/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|Skill Challenges]], there is always a maximum of 3 failures, but there are a number of special conditions that may influence the required number of success. For example:
	- If the party has hired a guide or has traveled through this same area multiple times before, this can decrease the number of successes required.
	- If the party has not gathered any intel about how to reach their destination or is attempting to travel to a secret location, this can increase the number of success required.
- If the party does not generate any failures, they arrive safely, well-rested, and without delay. 
- If the party has generated any failures, this results in some sort of complication to their travel plans. Complications could include (but are not limited to):
	- A combat encounter 
	- A social encounter 
	- Adverse weather or environmental conditions
	- Extra rations expended 
	- Delay in reaching destination 
	- Drawing unwanted attention
- If the party reaches 3 failures, this results in a major complication. Major complications could include (but are not limited to):
	- A difficult combat encounter 
	- A difficult social encounter 
	- Severe weather or environmental conditions
	- Suffering exhaustion 
	- Suffering injuries 
	- Getting lost 
- Only in the **most extreme** circumstances will failure result in the party not arriving at their destination at all; the [[2. Rules Reference/Skill Challenges/Travel - Skill Challenges\|travel skill challenge]] is generally meant to determine *how* they arrive, not *if* they arrive.
- For travel skill challenges, it is always acceptable to use [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Nature\|Nature]] and [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Survival\|Survival]]-- though any other [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|skill]] may also be attempted as long as its application can be appropriately described and justified (subject to GM discretion). 
- The DC for each [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|skill]] check is based on a) how applicable the skill is to the circumstances and b) the difficulty of the [[6. Common Knowledge/Travel/Wilderness/Terrain Types/Terrain Types\|terrain]]. This may be further modified by an individual character's relevant [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]], feats or class skills (such as Favored Terrain, or "I grew up in the woods").
- As with any other [[2. Rules Reference/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|Skill Challenge]], it is not possible for a single character to use the same [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|skill]] more than once, and it is not possible for a character to make an attempt for a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|skill]] that they are not at least Trained in.
