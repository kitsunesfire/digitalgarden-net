# Escape
#Attack 

You attempt to escape from being [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Grabbed\|Grabbed]], [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Immobilized\|Immobilized]], or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]].

Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your unarmed attack modifier against the DC of the effect. This is typically the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Athletics\|Athletics]] DC of a creature grabbing you, the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Thievery\|Thievery]] DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Athletics\|Athletics]] check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the #Attack trait).

- **Critical Success**. You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target. You can then Stride up to 5 feet.
- **Success**. You get free and remove the grabbed, immobilized, and restrained conditions imposed by your chosen target.
