# Point Out
#Auditory #Manipulate #Visual 

**Requirements.** A creature is undetected by one or more of your allies but isnâ€™t undetected by you.

You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally. That creature is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Hidden\|Hidden]] to your allies, rather than [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Undetected\|Undetected]]. This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target.

If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
