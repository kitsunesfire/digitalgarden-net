# Request
#Auditory #Concentrate #Linguistic #Mental 

You can make a request of a creature thatâ€™s [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Friendly\|Friendly]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Helpful\|Helpful]] to you. You must couch the request in terms that the target would accept given their current [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Attitude\|Attitude]] toward you. The GM sets the DC based on the difficulty of the request. Some requests are unsavory or impossible, and even a [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Helpful\|Helpful]] NPC would never agree to them.

- **Critical Success.** The target agrees to your request without qualifications.
- **Success.** The target agrees to your request, but they might demand added provisions or alterations to the request.
- **Failure.** The target refuses the request, though they might propose an alternative that is less extreme.
- **Critical Failure.** Not only does the target refuse the request, but their [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Attitude\|Attitude]] toward you decreases by one step due to the temerity of the request.
