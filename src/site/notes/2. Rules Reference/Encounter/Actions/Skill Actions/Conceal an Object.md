# Conceal an Object
#Manipulate #Secret 

You hide a small object on your person (such as a weapon of light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] check and compares it to this passive observerâ€™s Perception DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] DC (finding the object on success).

You can also conceal an object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Seek\|Seeking]] in an area compare their Perception check results to your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] DC to determine whether they find the object.

- **Success**. The object remains undetected.
- **Failure**. The searcher finds the object.
