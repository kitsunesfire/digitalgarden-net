# Create a Diversion
#Mental 

With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures' attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the #Manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the #Auditory and #Linguistic traits.

Attempt a single [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you're trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Create a Diversion\|Create a Diversion]] for 1 minute.

**Success** You become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Hidden\|Hidden]] to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Sneak\|Sneak]] away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Step\|Step]] or use the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Hide\|Hide]] or the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Sneak\|Sneak]] action of the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] skill. If you [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Strike\|Strike]] a creature, the creature remains [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Observed\|Observed]]. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.

**Failure** You donâ€™t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware you were trying to trick them.
