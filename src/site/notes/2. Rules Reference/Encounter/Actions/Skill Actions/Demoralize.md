# Demoralize
#Auditory #Concentrate #Emotion #Fear #Mental 

With a sudden shout, a well-timed taunt, or a cutting putdown, you can shake an enemy's resolve. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt an [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]] check against that target's Will DC.

If the target does not understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.

**Critical Success** The target becomes [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Frightened\|Frightened]] 2.  
**Success** The target becomes [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Frightened\|Frightened]] 1.
