# Command an Animal
#Auditory #Concentrate 

You issue an order to an animal. Attempt a [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Nature\|Nature]] check against the animal's Will DC. The GM might adjust the DC if the animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest a course of action it was predisposed toward, or you offer it a treat.

You automatically fail if the animal is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Hostile\|Hostile]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Unfriendly\|Unfriendly]] to you. If the animal is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Helpful\|Helpful]] to you, increase your degree of success by one step. You might be able to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Command an Animal\|Command an Animal]] more easily with a feat like Ride.

Most animals know the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Drop Prone\|Drop Prone]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Leap\|Leap]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Seek\|Seek]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Stand\|Stand]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Stride\|Stride]], and [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Strike\|Strike]] basic actions. If an animal knows an activity, such as a horse's Gallop, you can Command the Animal to perform the activity, but you must spend as many actions on [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Command an Animal\|Command an Animal]] as the activity's number of actions. You can also spend multiple actions to Command the Animal to perform that number of basic actions on its next turn; for instance, you could spend 3 actions to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Command an Animal\|Command an Animal]] to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Stride\|Stride]] three times or to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Stride\|Stride]] twice and then [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Strike\|Strike]].

**Success** The animal does as you command on its next turn.  
**Failure** The animal is hesitant or resistant, and it does nothing.  
**Critical Failure** The animal misbehaves or misunderstands, and it takes some other action determined by the GM.
