# Grapple
#Attack 

**Requirements** You have at least one free hand or have your target grappled or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]]. Your target isn't more than one size larger than you.

You attempt to grab a creature or object with your free hand. Attempt an Athletics check against the target's Fortitude DC. You can Grapple a target you already have [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Grabbed\|Grabbed]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]] without having a hand free.

**Critical Success** Your target is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]] until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes.  
**Success** Your target is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Grabbed\|Grabbed]] until the end of your next turn unless you move or your target Escapes.  
**Failure** You fail to grab your target. If you already had the target [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Grabbed\|Grabbed]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]] using a Grapple, those conditions on that creature or object end.  
**Critical Failure** If you already had the target [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Grabbed\|Grabbed]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Restrained\|Restrained]] , it breaks free. Your target can either grab you, as if it succeeded at using the Grapple action against you, or force you to fall and land [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Prone\|Prone]]
