# Hide
#Secret 

You huddle behind cover or greater cover or deeper into concealment to become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Hidden\|Hidden]], rather than [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Observed\|Observed]]. The GM rolls your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] check in secret and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you’re observed by but that you have cover or greater cover against or are concealed from. You gain the circumstance bonus from cover or greater cover to your check.

- **Success.** If the creature could see you, you’re now hidden from it instead of observed. If you were hidden from or undetected by the creature, you retain that condition.

If you successfully become hidden to a creature but then cease to have cover or greater cover against it or be concealed from it, you become observed again. You cease being hidden if you do anything except [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Hide\|Hide]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Sneak\|Sneak]], or [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Step\|Step]]. If you attempt to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Strike\|Strike]] a creature, the creature remains [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] against that attack, and you then become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Degrees of Detection/Observed\|Observed]]. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] check.

If a creature uses [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Seek\|Seek]] to make you observed by it, you must successfully [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Hide\|Hide]] to become hidden from it again.
