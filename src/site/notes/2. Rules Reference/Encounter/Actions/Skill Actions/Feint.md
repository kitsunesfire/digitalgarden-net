# Feint
#Mental 
**Requirements** You are within melee reach of the opponent you attempt to Feint.

With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared for your real attack. Attempt a [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] check against that opponent’s Perception DC.

**Critical Success** You throw your enemy’s defenses against you entirely off. The target is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.
**Success** Your foe is fooled, but only momentarily. The target is flat-footed against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
**Critical Failure** Your feint backfires. You are flat-footed against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.
