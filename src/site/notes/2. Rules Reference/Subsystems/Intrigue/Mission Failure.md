# Mission Failure

When the party has reached a state where they can no longer attempt to successfully complete the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]], this is called [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]]. In most cases, [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] is triggered by raising enemy [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] beyond a certain threshold, but specific [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|missions]] may have additional [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] triggers, such as exceeding a time limit or the capture of an escorted NPC. 

The consequences of [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] depend on the nature of the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]]. In some cases, it may still be possible to re-attempt the same [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] at a later time. However, in these cases, the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] typically starts with [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] levels already heightened and with additional [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|Complications]] added to reflect the additional defenses added by the target in response to the previous attempt.
