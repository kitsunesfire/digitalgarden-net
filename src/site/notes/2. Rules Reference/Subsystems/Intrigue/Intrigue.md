# Intrigue

Sometimes, subtlety is required to circumvent foes or accomplish a goal. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|Intrigue]] missions require you to employ guile and subtlety to achieve one or more objectives, usually without directly confronting your enemies. Your goal might be sneaking into a den of thieves to relieve them of ill-gotten gains, navigating the winding passages of the city watch headquarters to break a friend out of prison, or putting yourselves in just the right spot to snatch up the right person or the correct item at just the right time. 

Whatever the case, you must work together to avoid drawing the attention of an opposing party, such as the members of a thieves guild, the prison guards, or the invited guests at an upscale gala. Should your team draw too much attention, you might be attacked, arrested, or thrown out-- in any case, [[2.

[[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|Intrigue]] missions are fundamentally roleplay-focused and place over the course of multiple rounds. It is up to the GM how long a round is; one round might encompass 10 minutes or 1 hour of in-world time, or something completely different depending on the story.
