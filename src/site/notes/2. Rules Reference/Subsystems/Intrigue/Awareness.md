# Awareness

The trick to any [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] is to get it done before anyone notices. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] measures how informed your opposition is to your collective efforts, and can increase in three different ways:

1. When a PC fails a check to overcome an [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]]
2. At the end of each round of the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]], as the passage of time makes it incrementally more likely that you will be discovered or thwarted 
3. When your activities are disruptive enough to draw attention, subject to GM discretion  

As [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] increases, the challenges become harder and additional [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|Complications]] occur. If you raise [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] beyond a certain threshold, the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] enters into the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] state.
