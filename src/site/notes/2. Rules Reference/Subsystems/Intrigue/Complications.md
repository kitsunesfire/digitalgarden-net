# Complications

Sometimes, when a plan goes sour and seems like it can't get any worse... it does. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|Complications]] are unexpected problems that compound the difficulty of a challenge. You might trigger a complication by critically failing a check to overcome a challenge, as a consequence of your own decisions, or simply by the GM's design. 

Many [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|complications]] increase enemy [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] or otherwise make the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] more difficult. A common form of complication is attracting the attention of guards who try to stop, capture, or even kill you. When this happens, the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] may briefly shift into [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|encounter]] mode as you attempt to defeat your assailants or talk them out of fighting-- hopefully in a way that does not arouse further suspicions. The sounds of battle and argument are loud, after all, so unless the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|encounter]] occurs in an isolated area or you have taken special precautions, each round will cause [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] to rise, at the very least. 

Each complication has a trigger that determines when it occurs. It may affect only one of you, or it might affect all party members in a certain area, and it might be something that you can work together to overcome or it might be something that must be overcome individually. 

[[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|Complications]] **must** be overcome before anyone involved may attempt to overcome any other [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]], and attempting to overcome a complication takes your turn just like trying to overcome an obstacle. Many complications are one-off events that can be overcome automatically, even on a failure, though not without cost.
