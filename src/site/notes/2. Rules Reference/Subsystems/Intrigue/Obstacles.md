# Obstacles

Each [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]] within an [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]] is run like a miniature [[2. Rules Reference/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|skill challenge]]. They typically only require 1 or 2 successes to complete, but some challenging [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]] might require more. In some cases, it may even be possible to bypass an [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]] entirely through the creative use of a skill, spell, or item. Don't be afraid to use your imagination and your resources!

Some [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]] can be overcome collectively, but others must be overcome individually. For individual [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]], each party member needs to earn the required number of successes independently, while for group [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]], all of the party members that are working toward that obstacle may pool together their successes. For example, each party member trying to scale a wall typically must succeed on their own, but a party member who has already succeeded might be able to try to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Opportunities\|smooth the path]]. Additionally, the party can all work together to search a guildhall for clues, and once one party member has picked a lock, everyone can freely enter. 

In general, each [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]] is treated as a unique occurrence-- meaning, each specific character can only overcome an individual [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]]  once during a single [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]]; likewise, the party can only overcome a group [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]] once within the context of a single [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]]. 

## Obstacles in Play  

On your turn, describe what you do to get past the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]]. You will then attempt any required checks (or simply perform the action, if your choice does not require any checks). The result of your check determines how many successes you gain towards overcoming that [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]]-- or whether you instead raise [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]]!

**Critical Success** You gain 2 successes 
**Success** You gain 1 success  
**Failure** You raise [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]]  
**Critical Failure** You raise [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] and possibly trigger a [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|complication]]

Sometimes, someone might become stuck on an individual [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]]. However, there are [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Opportunities\|opportunities ]]for you and your allies to spend your turn trying to help others overcome a tricky [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacle]]. It's all about team effort!
