# Opportunities

Not everything that happens during a [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] is a challenge that must be solved-- sometimes you can use your turn to aid your allies in some way. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Opportunities\|Opportunities]] are very similar to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]], but they don't provide successes or count towards the completion of an objective. They instead provide some kind of benefit, such as a magical password to disable some security feature further along, or lowering the DC for a later challenge.

However, all [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Opportunities\|opportunities]] come with risks. Failing an opportunity always increases enemy [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] or triggers a [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Complications\|complication]]. You will need to decide which [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Opportunities\|opportunities]] are worth the risk, and who amongst your party is best suited for the extra challenge. 

## Opportunities in Play 

Below is an example of an opportunity that is always available in every [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]]:

### Smooth the Path
Prerequisite: You have successfully completed an individual objective, but at least one ally has not 

Having completed your objective, you help an ally who is still trying to reach that goal. Describe how you are helping. This gives the ally the benefits of [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Follow the Expert\|Follow the Expert]], even if you are not an expert in the requisite skill. In unusual cases, the GM might allow you to attempt a relevant skill check to overcome the obstacle on behalf of your ally instead.
