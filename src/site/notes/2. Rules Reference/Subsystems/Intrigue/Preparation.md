# Preparation

In most cases, the party will have a chance to prepare before executing a [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]]. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Preparation\|Preparation]] takes place during [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] and can grant the party unique [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intuition Points\|advantages]] and specialized resources that can help make their [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] a success, such as stolen uniforms, forged documents, and the like. As with [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Opportunities\|Opportunities]], careless work runs the risk of increasing [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]]-- in this case, before the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] has even begun! 

You will typically be limited in how much time you are given to prepare for any particular [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]]. Additionally, most [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Preparation\|Preparation]] activities can only grant their benefits once per [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]], so it is important to diversify your [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Preparation\|Preparation]] methods and take advantage of your party's strengths. Listed below are some examples of common [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Preparation\|Preparation]] activities, but your GM will usually allow for additional or custom activities if they link to your character, can reasonably be performed in your current environment, and are relevant to your [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]].
