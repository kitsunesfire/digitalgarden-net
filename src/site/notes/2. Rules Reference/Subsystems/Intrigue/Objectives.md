# Objectives

The main goal of an [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|Intrigue]] mission is to complete all of the required [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objectives]] before the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] state has been triggered. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] is usually a result of raising [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Awareness\|Awareness]] beyond a certain threshold, but specific [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|missions]] may have additional [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Mission Failure\|Mission Failure]] triggers, such as exceeding a time limit or the capture of an escorted NPC.    

To achieve an [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]], the party must overcome a certain number of [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]]. Once one member of the party has overcome the required number of [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]] to reach the [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]], they move on to the next [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]]. This might mean that some members of the party move on to a second [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]] and start making progress toward it while others are still completing [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|obstacles]] from the first [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]]. The [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] is only a success when all characters have completed the final [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]]. 

A [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] can consist of a single [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objective]], but usually include two or more [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|objectives]] in sequence-- for instance, the party might first need to find a way to enter the cult's sanctum, then open the vault, and then escape with the relic. Some [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|Objectives]] must be completed in a set sequence, while other times there may be [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Obstacles\|Obstacles]] that can be completed in any order. There may even be some instances where there are bonus [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|Objectives]], which are not necessary to complete at all but can yield some extra experience and/or rewards upon successful completion.

It is not wise to initiate a [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]] without at least some knowledge about the required [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|Objectives]]. In most cases, the party's [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Preparation\|Preparation]] will have already informed them of all of the required [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|Objectives]] related to their [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intrigue\|mission]]; extra effort will typically reveal any bonus [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|Objectives]] that might be available. If at any point you feel stuck or cannot find a way to progress with your [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Objectives\|Objectives]], you may exchange one of your [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Intrigue/Intuition Points\|Intuition Points]] for a clue.
