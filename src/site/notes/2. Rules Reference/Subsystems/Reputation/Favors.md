# Favors

Each favor the party performs for a faction normally improves their [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] with that faction. How quickly their [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] improves depends on the gravity of the favor:

- Minor favors are simple, basic tasks that donâ€™t take too much effort for a PC to perform or much time at the table. 
- Moderate favors require a significant amount of effort and often take up a session or a noticeable chunk of a single session to complete.
- Major favors are a sizable endeavor, typically an entire quest involving several sessions.
