# Disservices

[[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Disservices\|Disservices]] are a catchall for ways the party might make a group angry, whether it’s through actual malice and planning on the party's part or simply by accident. Unlike [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Favors\|Favors]], [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Disservices\|Disservices]] don’t have as easy a correspondence with in-game time; a quick but particularly egregious action could easily still be a major disservice. Disservices normally degrade the party's [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] with a faction. The degree to which it degrades depends on the severity of the disservice:

- Minor disservices could be small but significant missteps, or accumulated slights and inconveniences.
- Moderate disservices are more than just a nuisance or annoyance, generally significantly hindering the group’s efforts or violating a fundamental tenet of the group’s beliefs in a significant but not egregious way. 
- Major disservices are incredibly antagonistic to a group, usually a single brazen act, such as thwarting a cabal’s apocalyptic doomsday plan.
