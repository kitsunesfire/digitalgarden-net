# Ignored

The party is not on this faction's radar, or the faction knows about the party but is generally ambivalent to them. This is the default for most parties with most groups, and it carries no special benefits or detriments. 

If improved, upgrades to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Admired\|Admired]].
If degraded, downgrades to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hated\|Hated]].
