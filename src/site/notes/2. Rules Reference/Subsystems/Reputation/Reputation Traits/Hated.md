# Hated

The party has a poor reputation among members of this faction and earned their ire. Many members of the group know about the party, and are usually [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Hostile\|Hostile]] towards them. When presented an easy opportunity to hurt the party, this faction will jump at the chance-- but they usually won't go out of their way to do so. 

If improved, upgrades to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Ignored\|Ignored]].
If degraded, downgrades to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hunted\|Hunted]].
