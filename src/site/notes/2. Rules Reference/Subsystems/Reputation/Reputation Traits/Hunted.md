# Hunted

This faction actively hunts the party down as scapegoats or nemeses, even at significant cost to themselves. Every member has heard of the party and is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Hostile\|Hostile]] towards them, and would generally be willing to take major risks to thwart or destroy them. They will do their best to make the party [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Infamous\|Infamous]] with other groups.

If improved, upgrades to [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hated\|Hated]].
Cannot be degraded.
