# Reputation

While attitudes are useful for tracking an individual's relationship to the party members, sometimes it can be important to know how whole groups of people feel about your entire party. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] is a trait given to a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Factions\|faction]] represents a generalized impression across the whole group-- individual NPCs can hold different opinions. 

There are five core [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] traits:

- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Revered\|Revered]]
- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Admired\|Admired]]
- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Ignored\|Ignored]]
- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hated\|Hated]]
- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hunted\|Hunted]]

The party generally starts with a reputation of ==Ignored== with most groups, as most groups have never heard of you. However, if you have started to make a name for yourself (through highly publicized actions or patterns of behavior, for example), you may start at a different reputation of the GM's choice. Each of these [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] traits are earned through meaningful (but not always intentional) action on the party's behalf. If the party would like to intentionally work on improving their reputation with a particular faction, the best way to do this is to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Socialize/Gain Renown\|Gain Renown]] during [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] or to follow through on any faction-specific [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Favors\|Favors]] you might have available to you. On the flip side, it is also possible for the party to worsen their [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]]with a faction. [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Disservices\|Disservices]] are a catchall for the myriad of ways the party might make a group angry, whether it's through actual malice and planning on the party's part or simply by accident. In most cases, [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] only shifts by one degree at a time, but actions such as major [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Favors\|Favors]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Disservices\|Disservices]] may cause a more dramatic shift of opinion.

In addition, there are two temporary traits that can be combined with any of the five above:

- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Allied\|Allied]]
- [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Infamous\|Infamous]] 

Any group with the ==Allied== trait is temporarily working with the party, while a group with the ==Infamous== trait means that they will temporarily refuse to work with the party. While unlikely, it is possible for a faction that [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hated\|hates]] or is even [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Hunted\|hunting]] the party to temporarily [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Allied\|ally]] with them-- usually as a last resort, to defeat a mutual enemy of some kind. Likewise, it is unlikely but possible for a faction that [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Admired\|admires]] or even [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Revered\|reveres]] the party to temporarily regard them as [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Infamous\|Infamous]], should the party act in a manner they simply cannot condone. The [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Allied\|Allied]] and [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation Traits/Infamous\|Infamous]] traits are always combined with one of the five core [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Reputation/Reputation\|Reputation]] traits and are always temporary, though they may be renewed indefinitely should the circumstances of the faction's relationships remain unchanged.
