# Subsystems

[[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Subsystems\|Subsystems]] are extensions of the main rules which allow characters to explore a particular topic or style of play more in-depth than usual. 

### Victory Points

Victory Points are a generic structure that is used by GMs to track progress towards a party's (or character's) goal so that their successes and failures can be meaningfully measured and calculated. Many [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Subsystems\|Subsystems]] use Victory Points, though often by a different name. 

Victory Points are most often used to measure abstract concepts such as "approval" or give a measurement to complicated statuses such as "having an advantage". They can also used to convey urgency, add dramatic tension, or emphasize the magnitude of a situation by focusing on what is at stake should the victory condition(s) not be met. 

Victory Points are versatile; they can track something that is resolved within a single encounter or scene, or they can be collected over the course of an entire adventure or campaign to determine the ending of the story. The most common structure is to accumulate Victory Points towards a total, either stopping after reaching a success threshold or collecting as many Victory Points as possible in a given time frame and then measuring the results against various thresholds. 

When the Victory Points subsystem is used in a large scale, like over the course of an adventure or campaign, it is common for PCs to be awarded Victory Points for achieving difficult goals or making particular decisions in addition to their usual rewards. This usually culminates in the PCs eventually having their accumulated Victory Points compared against several ranked tiers that each have varying results on the outcome of the story. 

Though less common, it is also possible for the antagonists to utilize one or more Victory Points systems. For example, it could be that the party enters a town that is heavily under the influence of their opposition and must take actions to attempt to erode that support. In this example, the influence of the antagonists may be represented by 20 Victory Points, and the party has a set amount of time during which they must change public opinion-- by sabotaging their opponent and reducing their Victory Points total and/or earning enough support of their own and earn more Victory Points than their opponents.
