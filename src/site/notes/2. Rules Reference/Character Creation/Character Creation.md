# Character Creation

To make a character for this setting, you will need to complete these steps:  

- [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestry]]
	- Heritage
- Class
- Archetypes
- Background
	- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] 
	- [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Old World Atlas\|Region]] 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] 
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Attribute Modifiers\|Attribute Modifiers]]
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|Skills]] 
	- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]]
- Other Details
  
These steps do not necessarily need to be completed in the order presented, but they are all essential parts of building a new character. When making a new character in Pf2e, most people primarily focus on [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|ancestry]] or class ideas for their characters first, and use background details to help flesh out their idea and concept later on. If you don't know where to start, you might also be able to get some inspiration by exploring the diverse [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Old World Atlas\|regions]] of Sharum Mal'Kari!

## Ancestry

[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\| Ancestry]] determines your character's size, speed, and contributes to their Hit Points. Each also grant ability boosts and flaws to represent the ancestry's basic capabilities. You will need to make four decisions when you select your[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\| ancestry]]:

1. Pick the[[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\| ancestry]] itself
2. Assign any free ability boosts 
3. Select a heritage 
4. Choose an ancestry feat 

As a player, you may freely choose any of the Common Ancestries for your character; Uncommon Ancestries require GM approval. Keep in mind that this setting uses the [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Ancestral Paragon\|Ancestral Paragon]] variant ruleset, so you will be selecting ancestry feats more frequently than the standard rules expect you to.

### Heritage

Every ancestry has unique heritages they can choose from, which represent some of the diversity present in each ancestry’s bloodlines. There are a small number of ancestral heritage options which are restricted in this setting; please read the "Setting Details" section of your chosen [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|ancestry]] for more details.

#### Versatile Heritage

In addition, all ancestries can be influenced by a versatile heritage. To play with a versatile heritage, first select your [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|ancestry]] and then choose from one of the heritages listed instead of a traditional heritage for that ancestry. 

In Sharum Mal'Kari versatile heritage are all #Uncommon as they represent a linage that is connected in some way to an otherworldly being. If you are interested in one of the versatile heritage options, it is very important to thoroughly read their associated wiki pages, as the flavor and context of these heritages is rather significantly changed from their Pathfinder 2e equivalent.

## Class

At this time, there aren't any Pf2e classes that are banned in this setting.

While a good deal of Sharum Mal'Kari's [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|Magic]] has been renamed and reimagined, it lines up with the mechanics as written for Pathfinder 2. One of the biggest differences is that this setting uses homebrewed [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] instead of the standard Pathfinder pantheon. Therefore, if you intend to play as a divine caster, you will need to familiarize yourself with the deities of Sharum Mal'Kari and may need to collaborate with the GM to clarify additional details as-needed.

## Archetypes

In Pathfinder 2e, advanced customization outside your class is accomplished through the use of archetypes. Instead of classic multiclassing, it is possible for characters to multiclass using a Multiclass Archetype.

This setting also uses the [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Free Archetype\|Free Archetype]] variant ruleset, which grants additional opportunities to take archetype feats. In general, you may choose any common archetypes that you meet the requirements for and suits your character concept. However, there may be some paralogue adventures that have special archetype requirements and/or restrictions; these adjustments will be made clear in the sign-up stage. 

## Background

Background is another way to refine your character, representing your character’s past experiences before they became an adventurer and who they are as a person. Your Background provides additional ability boosts and training in specific skills, including at least one type of lore and one skill feat. 

## Languages

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] 

Since this setting does not have ancestry-based languages, all characters start with

- Common (Veretian)
- 1 #Uncommon language from their region (if applicable)
- Additional languages equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive)

## Attribute Modifiers

Each attribute starts at +0, but your other character creation choices will adjust these scores by applying boosts and flaws. As you build your character, remember to apply adjustments when making the following decisions:

**Ancestry**: each ancestry provides ability boosts, and sometimes an ability flaw.

**Background**: your character's background provides two ability boosts.

**Class**: your character's class provides an ability boost to the ability score most important to your class, called your _key ability score_.

After all the other steps, you apply four more ability boosts of your choice; when you gain multiple ability boosts at the same time (like this), you must apply each one to a different stat. Please note that at 1st level a character can never have any ability score that is higher than +4 or less than -1.

## Skills

Each skill is keyed to one of your character's ability scores and is used for an array of related actions. Your character's level of expertise in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class. Some classes depend heavily on certain skills-- such as the alchemist's reliance on crafting-- but for most classes, you can choose whichever skills make the most sense for your character's theme and backstory at 1st level, then use their adventure and [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] experiences to inform how their skills should improve as your character levels up.
