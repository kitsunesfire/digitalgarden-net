# Contacts

A [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Contacts\|Contact]] describes someone that the character has met and has earned some amount of influence or advantage with. This might be a link to a particular faction, or represent a favor owed by an associate. They can be from a character's past, or represent NPCs met during play that the player wishes to retain. [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Contacts\|Contacts]] are usually-- but not always-- positive. 

A [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Contacts\|Contact]] is similar to a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Bonds\|Bond]], but tends to be far less personal. Over time, it is possible for a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Contacts\|Contact]] to become a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Bonds\|Bond]].

Characters select one [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Contacts\|Contact]] during [[Character Creation\|Character Creation]], and may add more later.
