# Character Traits

[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] are special traits that are unique to a specific PC. Every character begins with a set of [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] that they generate during character creation, and can gain more as they level up and interact with the world. 

## Character Traits & Character Development

As part of the character creation process, each player works with the GM to generate a set of specific [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]]. Each player is free to choose the exact wording of their traits, but some traits are required to be based on existing character creation choices or may have other restrictions. All [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] should reflect the character's attributes, attitudes and abilities, and as such they should be relatively consistent. 

Starting at level 2 and each level thereafter, your character gains a new Character Trait of any type (except [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/High Concept\|High Concept]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Origin\|Origin]]).; they may have the opportunity to earn additional [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] by accomplishing narrative milestones or participating in long-term [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]]. Any time your character would earn a Character Trait, they may also have a possibility of rewriting 1 existing Character Trait into a new one. 

## Types of Character Traits 

There are 2 types of [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Character Traits\|Character Traits]] which are only chosen during character creation: 

- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/High Concept\|High Concept]] 
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Origin\|Origin]] 

In addition, there are 7 other types of traits that your character starts with and can also be gained as your character develops:

- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Aesthetics\|Aesthetics]] 
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Attributes\|Attributes]] 
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Bonds\|Bonds]]

- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Goals\|Goals]] 
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Rumors\|Rumors]] 
- [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerabilities]] 

Of course, this list is expandable to any kind of element that might represent character growth. If you have something in mind that doesn't quite match one of the categories listed, ask your GM!
