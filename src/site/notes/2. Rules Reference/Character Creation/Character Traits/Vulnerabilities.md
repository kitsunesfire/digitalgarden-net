# Vulnerabilities

[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerabilities]] describe an important negative element of the character that makes their life more complicated. This might be a personal weakness, a flaw, a vice, a limitation, a difficult entanglement, an obligation that holds them back, or a part of them that can be easily exploited. 

Characters select one [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Character Traits/Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerability]] during [[Character Creation\|Character Creation]], and may add more later.
