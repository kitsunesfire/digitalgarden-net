# Acrobatics

Acrobatics measures your ability to perform tasks requiring coordination and grace. When you use the [Escape](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=79) basic action, you can use your Acrobatics modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.

# Balance ![1-1action.png](/img/user/x.%20Assets/Formatting/Pf2e%20Icons/1-1action.png)

**Requirements** You are in a square that contains a narrow surface, uneven ground, or another similar feature.

You move across a narrow surface or uneven ground, attempting an [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] check against its Balance DC. You are [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] while on a narrow surface or uneven ground.

**Critical Success** You move up to your Speed.  
**Success** You move up to your Speed, treating it as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement).  
**Failure** You must remain stationary to keep your balance (wasting the action) or you fall. If you fall, your turn ends.  
**Critical Failure** You fall and your turn ends.

## Sample Balance Tasks

**Untrained** tangled roots, uneven cobblestones  
**Trained** wooden beam  
**Expert** deep, loose gravel  
**Master** tightrope, smooth sheet of ice  
**Legendary** razor’s edge, chunks of floor falling in midair

# Tumble Through ![1-1action.png](/img/user/x.%20Assets/Formatting/Pf2e%20Icons/1-1action.png)

You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space. You can Tumble Through using Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.

**Success** You move through the enemy’s space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.  

**Failure** Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.

# Maneuver in Flight ![1-1action.png](/img/user/x.%20Assets/Formatting/Pf2e%20Icons/1-1action.png)
#Move #Trained

**Requirements** You have a fly Speed.

You try a difficult maneuver while flying. Attempt an Acrobatics check. The GM determines what maneuvers are possible, but they rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.

- **Success** You succeed at the maneuver.
- **Failure** Your maneuver fails. The GM chooses if you simply can’t move or if some other detrimental effect happens. The outcome should be appropriate for the maneuver you attempted (for instance, being blown off course if you were trying to fly against a strong wind).
- **Critical Failure** As failure, but the consequence is more dire.

## Sample Maneuver in Flight Tasks

**Trained** steep ascent or descent
**Expert** fly against the wind, hover midair
**Master** reverse direction
**Legendary** fly through gale force winds

# Squeeze
#Exploration #Move #Recon 

Prerequisite: Trained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] 

You contort yourself to squeeze through a space so small you can barely fit through. This action is for exceptionally small spaces; many tight spaces are Difficult Terrain that you can move through more quickly and without a check.

- **Critical Success** You squeeze through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
- **Success** You squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
- **Critical Failure** You become stuck in the tight space. While you’re stuck, you can spend 1 minute attempting another [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] check at the same DC. Any result on that check other than a critical failure causes you to become unstuck.

## Sample Squeeze Tasks

**Trained** space barely fitting your shoulders
**Master** space barely fitting your head
