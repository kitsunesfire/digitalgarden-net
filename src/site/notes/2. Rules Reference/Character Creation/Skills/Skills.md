# Skills

While your character’s [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Attribute Modifiers\|Attribute Modifiers]] represent their raw talent and potential, [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|Skills]] represent their training and experience at performing certain tasks. Each skill is keyed to one of your character’s [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Attribute Modifiers\|Attribute Modifiers]] and used for an array of related actions. Your character’s expertise in a skill comes from several sources, including their background and class.

## Acrobatics

[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] measures your ability to perform tasks requiring coordination and grace. When you use the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Escape\|Escape]] basic action, you can use your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Acrobatics\|Acrobatics]] modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.

## Arcana

[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Arcana\|Arcana]] measures how much you know about arcane magic and creatures. Even if you're untrained, you can [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] 

- [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] about arcane theories; creatures of arcane significance (like [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|Dragon]] and beasts); and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]].

### Arcana Trained Actions

You must be trained in Arcana to use it for the following general skill actions.

- [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Decipher Writing\|Decipher Writing]] about arcane theory.
- [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Identify Magic\|Identify Magic]], particularly [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]].
- [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Learn a Spell\|Learn a Spell]] 

## Athletics

[[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Athletics\|Athletics]] allows you to perform deeds of physical prowess. When you use the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Escape\|Escape]] basic action, you can use your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Athletics\|Athletics]] modifier instead of your unarmed attack modifier.

## Crafting

You can use this skill to create, understand, and repair [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Specialty Items\|Specialty Items]]. Even if you're untrained, you can [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]].

- [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] about [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|alchemical reactions]], the value of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Specialty Items\|Specialty Items]], engineering, unusual [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Materials\|Materials]] and alchemical or mechanical creatures.

### Crafting Trained Actions

You must be trained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Crafting\|Crafting]] to use it to [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Commerce/Earn Income\|Earn Income]].

- [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Commerce/Earn Income\|Earn Income]] by crafting goods for the market.

## Deception

With [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]], you can trick and mislead others using disguises, lies, and other forms of subterfuge.

## Diplomacy

With [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]], you influence others through negotiation and flattery.

## Intimidation

With [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]], you bend others to your will using threats.

## Lore

You have specialized information on a narrow topic. [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] features many subcategories. You might have Military Lore, Sailing Lore, Vampire Lore, or any similar subcategory of the skill. Each subcategory counts as its own skill, so applying a skill increase to Planar Lore wouldn't increase your proficiency with Sailing Lore, for example.

You gain a specific subcategory of the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] skill from your background. The GM determines what other subcategories they'll allow as [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] skills, though these categories are always less broad than any of the other skills that allow you to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]], and they should never be able to fully or mainly take the place of another skill's [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] action. For instance, you couldn't choose Magic Lore to recall the breadth of knowledge about magic covered by Arcana, Nature, Occultism, and Religion, or Adventuring Lore to give you all the information an adventurer needs, or Planar Lore to gain all the information spread across various skills and subcategories such as Heaven Lore.

If you have multiple subcategories of [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] that could apply to a check or that would overlap with another skill in the circumstances, you can use the skill with the better skill modifier or the one you would prefer to use. If there's any doubt whether a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] skill applies to a specific topic or action, the GM decides whether it can be used or not.

Even if you're untrained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]], you can use it to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]].

- [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] about the subject of your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] skill's subcategory.

### Lore Trained Actions

- [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Commerce/Earn Income\|Earn Income]] by using your knowledge to practice a trade.

## Medicine

You can patch up wounds and help people recover from diseases and poisons. Even if you're untrained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Medicine\|Medicine]], you can use it to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]].

- **[[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]]** about diseases, injuries, poisons, and other ailments. You can use this to perform forensic examinations if you spend 10 minutes (or more, as determined by the GM) checking for evidence such as wound patterns. This is most useful when determining how a body was injured or killed.

## Nature

You know a great deal about the natural world, and you command and train animals and magical beasts. Even if you're untrained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Nature\|Nature]], you can use it to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]].

- **[[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]]** about fauna, flora, geography, [[Weather\|Weather]], the environment, creatures of natural origin, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]], [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]].

### Nature Trained Actions

You know a great deal about ancient philosophies, esoteric lore, obscure mysticism, and supernatural creatures. Even if you're untrained in [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Occultism\|Occultism]], you can use it to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]].

- [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] about ancient mysteries; obscure philosophies; creatures of occult significance; and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]].

## Performance

You are skilled at a form of [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Performance\|Performance]], using your talents to impress a crowd or make a living.

### Basic Competence

Some performances require you to be more than just charismatic, and if you don't meet the demands of the art form or the audience, the GM might apply a penalty based on the relevant ability score. For example, if you're dancing and have a negative Dexterity modifier, you might take a penalty to your attempt at dancing. Likewise, if you are orating and have a negative Intelligence modifier, you might have to hope your raw Charisma can overcome the penalties from your intellectual shortcomings—or ask someone to help write your speeches!

### Performance Traits

When you use an action that utilizes the [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Performance\|Performance]] skill, it gains one or more traits relevant to the type of performance.

The secrets of deities, dogma, [[6. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Faith\|Faith]], and the realms of divine creatures both sublime and sinister are open to you. You also understand how [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]] works, though your training imparts a religious slant to that knowledge. Even if you're untrained in [[2.

You understand the people and systems that make civilization run, and you know the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/History\|historical events]] that make societies what they are today.

Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] about local history, important personalities, legal institutions, societal structure, and humanoid cultures.
