# Society

You understand the people and systems that make civilization run, and you know the historical events that make societies what they are today. Further, you can use that knowledge to navigate the complex physical, societal, and economic workings of settlements. Even if you’re untrained in Society, you can use it for the following general skill actions.

-   **[Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5&General=true)** about local history, important personalities, legal institutions, societal structure, and humanoid cultures. The GM might allow Society to apply to other creatures that are major elements of society in your region, such as the draconic nobility in a kingdom of humans ruled by dragons.
-   **[Subsist](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=6&General=true)** in a settlement by finding shelter, scrounging, or begging for food.
