# Attribute Modifiers

Each attribute modifier starts at +0, but your other character creation choices will adjust these values by applying boosts and flaws. As you build your character, remember to apply adjustments when making the following decisions:

- **Ancestry**: each ancestry provides attribute boosts, and sometimes an attribute flaw.
- **Background**: your character's background provides two attribute boosts.
- **Class**: your character's class provides an attribute boost to the attribute most important to your class, called your _key attribute.

After all the other steps, you apply **four more** attribute boosts of your choice; when you gain multiple attribute boosts at the same time (like this), you must apply each one to a different stat. Please note that at 1st level a character can never have any ability score that is higher than +4 or less than -1.
