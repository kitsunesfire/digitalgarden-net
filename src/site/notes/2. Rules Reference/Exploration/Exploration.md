# Exploration

[[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] lacks the immediate danger of [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]] mode, but it offers its own challenges. [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode is generally used when there may be some amount of risk, but no immediate danger. While this mode is often used in an environment where you are likely to face monsters or hazards, you will usually stay in [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode until you actually enter an [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]] or otherwise engage in some kind of direct interaction. 

## Time Scale 

While [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]] mode uses rounds to track the passage of time, [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode is intentionally more free form; it's rarely measured out to the second or minute. As a result, during [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]], the GM will frequently need to make judgement calls on just about everything that happens. The GM may speed up or slow down how quickly things are happening as needed. If it's important to know how much time is passing, time spent in [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode can usually be estimated in 10-minute increments. 

## Actions and Reactions 

Though [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] isn't broken into rounds, [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Exploration Activities\|Exploration Activities]] generally assume that the you are spending at least part of your time using standard [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Actions\|Actions]], such as [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Seek\|Seek]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Interact\|Interact]]. If you have specific [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] you would like your character to use, you should ask; the GM will then decide whether the action(s) apply, and whether to switch to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]] mode for greater detail. You can generally use any relevant reactions that may come up during [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode.
