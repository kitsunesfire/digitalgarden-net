# Make an Impression
#Auditory #Concentrate #Exploration #Linguistic #Mental #Recon 

With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage in charismatic overtures, flattery, and other acts of goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them temporarily agreeable.

At the end of the conversation, attempt a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] check against the Will DC of one target, modified by any circumstances the GM sees fit. Good impressions (or bad impressions, on a critical failure) last for only the current social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.

- **Critical Success.** The target’s [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Attitude\|Attitude]] toward you improves by two steps.
- **Success.** The target’s [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Attitude\|Attitude]] toward you improves by one step.
- **Critical Failure.** The target’s [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Attitude/Attitude\|Attitude]] toward you decreases by one step.
