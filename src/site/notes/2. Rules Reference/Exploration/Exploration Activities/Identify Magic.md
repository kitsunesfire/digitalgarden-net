# Identify Magic
#Concentrate #Exploration #Secret  

Once you [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Detect Magic Adjustments\|discover that an item, location, or ongoing effect is magical]], you can spend 10 minutes to try to identify the particulars of its [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]]. If your attempt is interrupted, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check. Cursed or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using this activity alone. Heightening a spell doesn’t increase the DC to identify it.

- **Critical Success.** If the magic has a curse, you learn all the attributes of the curse. You automatically succeed at future attempts to identify this same magic.
- **Success.** You learn all the attributes of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]], including its name (for an effect), what it does, any means of activating it (for an item or location). You cannot determine whether or not the magic has a curse.
- **Failure.** You fail to identify the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]] and can’t try again for 1 hour.
- **Critical Failure.** You fail to identify the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]] and can’t try again for 1 day.

### Magical Traditions and Skills
Each magical tradition has a corresponding skill, as shown on the table below. You must have the trained proficiency rank in a skill to use it to [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Identify Magic\|Identify Magic]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Learn a Spell\|Learn a Spell]]. Something without a specific tradition, such as an item with the #Magical trait, can be identified using any of these skills.

| Magical Tradition | Corresponding Skill |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]]        | [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Arcana\|Arcana]]              |

| [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]]        | [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Nature\|Nature]]              |

### Skill Proficiency and Identification 
 If you have Master proficiency in the skill you are using to [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Identify Magic\|Identify Magic]], you automatically Succeed if the item or effect is 4th level or lower; with Legendary proficiency, you automatically Succeed with items and effects of 9th level and lower.
