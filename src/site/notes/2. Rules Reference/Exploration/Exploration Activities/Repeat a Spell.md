# Repeat a Spell
#Concentrate #Exploration #Move #Recon 

You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half speed. Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in 2 actions or fewer. In order to prevent fatigue due to repeated casting, youâ€™ll likely use this activity only when something out of the ordinary occurs.  
  
You can instead use this activity to continue [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Specialty Actions/Sustain a Spell\|Sustaining a Spell]] or Activation with a sustained duration. Most such spells or item effects can only be sustained for 10 minutes, though some specify they can be sustained for a different duration.
