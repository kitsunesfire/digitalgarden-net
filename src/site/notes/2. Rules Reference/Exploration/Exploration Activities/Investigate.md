# Investigate
#Concentrate #Exploration #Move #Recon 

You seek out information about your surroundings while traveling at half speed. You use [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] as a secret check to discover clues among the various things you can see and engage with as you journey along. You can use any skill that has a [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Recall Knowledge\|Recall Knowledge]] action while Investigating, but the GM determines whether the skill is relevant to the clues you could find.
