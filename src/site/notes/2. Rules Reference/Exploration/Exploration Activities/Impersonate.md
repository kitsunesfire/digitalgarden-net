# Impersonate
#Concentrate #Exploration #Manipulate #Secret #Recon 

You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a Disguise Kit, but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you’re not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM’s discretion.

In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] only if they use the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Seek\|Seek]] action to attempt Perception checks against your [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] check for you against that creature’s Perception DC instead. If you’re disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you’re imitating, or the GM might roll a secret [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] check even if you aren’t directly interacting with others.

- **Success.** You trick the creature into thinking you’re the person you’re disguised as. You might have to attempt a new check if your behavior changes.
- **Failure.** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be.
- **Critical Failure.** The creature can tell you’re not who you claim to be, and it recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.
