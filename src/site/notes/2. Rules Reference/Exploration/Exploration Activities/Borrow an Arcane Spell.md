# Borrow an Arcane Spell
#Concentrate #Exploration #Trained #Recon 

If you’re a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|mana]] spellcaster who prepares from a spellbook, you can attempt to prepare a spell from someone else’s spellbook. The GM sets the DC for the check based on the spell’s level and rarity; it’s typically a bit easier than [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Learn a Spell\|learning the spell]].

- **Success** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal spell preparation.
- **Failure** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can’t try to prepare this spell until the next time you prepare spells.
