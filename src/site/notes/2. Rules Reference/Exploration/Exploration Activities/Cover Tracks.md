# Cover Tracks
#Concentrate #Exploration #Move #Recon

You cover your tracks, moving up to half your [travel speed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=470). You don’t need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.  
  
In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]]. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn’t have the exploration trait.
