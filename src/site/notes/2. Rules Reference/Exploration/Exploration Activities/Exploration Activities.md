# Exploration Activities

In [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode, any time you want to do something beyond just traveling, you must choose an exploration activity for your character. The most common [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Exploration Activities\|Exploration Activities]] are [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Avoid Notice\|Avoid Notice]], [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Detect Magic\|2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Detect Magic]], [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Hustle\|Hustle]], and [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Search\|Search]], though there are many options available. Additionally, there are many activities which require training in a skill; see [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Skill Exploration Activities\|Skill Exploration Activities]] for more details.

There is no need to memorize the [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Exploration Activities\|Exploration Activities]] and use them exactly as described-- instead, simply describe what your character is doing and allow the GM to determine which activity best applies. These entries have been provided merely as guidelines and suggestions, and to give examples for the kinds of activities that are possible and expected during [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode. However, keep in mind that there may be times that a GM determines that an activity may work slightly differently in a particular set of circumstance, in order to better fit a character's actions in the moment. 

If you want to do something that is not covered by the rules, a GM may sometimes improvise a new activity. Please note that this may not always be possible, especially when attempting to use combat abilities or [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Actions\|Actions]] in [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode. This is because, while characters may be able to exert themselves to accomplish tremendous things in the heat of battle, this is only because [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|encounters]] last such a short time; such exertion simply isn't sustainable over the longer time frame of [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]].
