# Avoid Notice
#Exploration #Move #Recon

You attempt a [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Stealth\|Stealth]] check to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you have the [Swift Sneak](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=850) feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can’t use another exploration activity while you do so. If you have the [Legendary Sneak](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=807) feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity. If you’re Avoiding Notice at the start of an [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]], you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).
