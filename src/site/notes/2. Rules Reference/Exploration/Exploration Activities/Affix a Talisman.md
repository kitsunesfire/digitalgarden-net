# Affix a Talisman
#Exploration #Manipulate #Recon 

**Requirements** You must use a [repair kit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=43).

You spend 10 minutes affixing a [talisman](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&Subcategory=19) to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair kit with both hands. You can also use this activity to remove a talisman. Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
