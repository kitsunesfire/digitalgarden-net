# 2. Rules Reference

Adventuring in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] alternates between three core modes of play: [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]], [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Encounter\|Encounter]], and [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]]. Each mode represents different kinds of situations with different time scales, and characters can use different sorts of actions and activities in each. In addition, there are a number of [[2. Rules Reference/Subsystems/Subsystems\|Subsystems]], which are situational gameplay modes that can help provide structure to common-but-complicated activities.
