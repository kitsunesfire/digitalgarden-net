# Biome DC

The average dangers faced in Sharum Mal'Kari vary greatly from one biome to another. To quantify these dangers, your GM will set a [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Biome DC\|Biome DC]], which is the base DC required for success at any [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Skills\|skill]] check involved with interacting with local threat levels, such as securing a campsite, foraging, or keeping watch. The values listed below represent the standard DC for each type of biome, though your GM may adjust this value.
