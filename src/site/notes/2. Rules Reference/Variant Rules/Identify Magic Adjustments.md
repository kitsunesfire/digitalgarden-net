# Identify Magic Adjustments

The rules as written for identifying magic have a tendency to slow the game down and feel unsatisfying in ways that are neither fun for the players nor the GM. In this setting, [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Identify Magic\|Identify Magic]] has been adjusted in the following ways:

- On a Success, this player receives full details of the magic in question (the usual Critical Success result) instead of a vague sense of the magic's properties, except for cursed items. 
- On a Critical Success, this player reveals the true nature of cursed items and automatically Succeeds at any future attempts to identify this same magic.
- On a Critical Failure, this player cannot identify the magic in question and cannot make another attempt to so for 1 day (the usual Failure result).
- On a Failure, this player cannot identify the magic in question and cannot make another attempt to do so for 1 hour (instead of 1 day).
- If you have Master proficiency in the skill you are using to [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration Activities/Identify Magic\|Identify Magic]], you automatically Succeed if the item or effect is 4th level or lower; with Legendary proficiency, you automatically Succeed with items and effects of 9th level and lower.
