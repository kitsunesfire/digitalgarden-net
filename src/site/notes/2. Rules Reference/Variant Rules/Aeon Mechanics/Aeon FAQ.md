# Aeon FAQ

Summoner eidolons tend to have some tricky rules that are up to GM interpretation. Given that your [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] are specialized, custom eidolons, the rules surrounding their use are even more unclear. Below I have compiled an FAQ to help pre-emptively answer some questions I anticipate, as well as how I (currently) intend on ruling. Please keep in mind that all of this is subject to revision as we advance through the campaign.

**Q: Can Aeons use mundane (i.e. non-magical) items?**
A: Yes, Aeons can use any mundane items or tools that they have the appropriate body type for. For example, a fox Aeon would not be able to lockpick with thieves’ tools—but a kitsune (in humanoid form) could 😉

**Q: Can Aeons use magical items?**
A: In general, no, unless the item has the Aeon tag. Unfortunately, there are currently only two officially published items with this tag. Hopefully there will be more someday! I’m already looking into some custom items for the future…

**Q: What about _alchemical_ items?**
A: Since alchemical items are explicitly non-magical items per Pathfinder rules, yes, they can use alchemical items. Which, admittedly, is weird. But I’m not fighting it.

**Q: So, does that mean Aeons can drink potions?**
A: Rules as Written, no. Rules as Intended, likely yes-- so I’m going to say yes. 😊

**Q: Can an Aeon carry items?**
A: In general, yes, Aeons follow standard creature rules for carrying capacity (up to 5+STR mod bulk). However, your Aeons are _special_ and behave a little bit differently; in early levels, your Aeons are limited to only half their normal carrying capacity, rounded down. Don’t worry, the story will explain why this is! Later on, they will be able to regain their full carrying capacity once more. Please note that just because an Aeon _can_ carry items for you, it does not mean they always _will_, especially if you have a poor relationship with the Aeon in question.

**Q: What happens to an Aeon’s items when they un-manifest?**
A: In early levels, if your Aeon un-manifests while carrying items, any items on their person drop to the ground; the primary exceptions to this rule are their clothing, jewelry, or similar simple personal effects. In later levels, they will be able to transport the items they are carrying with them when they are manifested/un-manifested. However, like carrying items, just because they _can_ doesn’t always mean they _will_. Be nice to your Aeon!

**Q: What happens to the Aeon itself when it un-manifests?**
A: They return to wherever they were when they were summoned; this can be assumed to be either somewhere else in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] or in [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]]. 

**Q: Are Aeons still effected by persistent damage / persistent healing / poison / similar effects when they are un-manifested?**
A: Of all of the questions on this page, this one is probably the hardest to answer (and most likely to be revisited). For now, I'm ruling that *yes*, the Aeon technically continues to be effected for the duration. After all, an un-manifested Aeon doesn't cease to exist-- they just get warped back to their previous location. So long as the link between Aeon and Host remains intact, the effects persist. However, in the case that a Host drops to 0HP, their life force is so weak that it causes the link to the Aeon to temporarily fail, dropping all persistent damage from the Aeon.

**Q: Do Aeons need to eat or sleep?**
A: In early levels, they do not need to eat but will require some form of rest—usually either in the form of standard sleep or a deep meditative state. In later levels, on they will require both food and rest just like anyone else.

**Q: Can Aeons perform downtime activities?**
A: Typically, no. However, after they become empowered, they will first be able to cooperate on the same downtime task as their host; eventually, they will be able to act fully autonomously, including taking independent downtime activities separate from their host.  

**Q: What does it look like when I manifest my Aeon?**
A: Short answer—it depends on your Aeon! For example, an angelic Aeon might descend from the skies, or a plant Aeon might rapidly grow from a sprout, or an undead Aeon might claw itself out from under some loose dirt. The only detail that must be consistent is that any time your Aeon is actively summoned, both your and your Aeon’s sigils will glow. Feel free to get creative! Just make sure you run it by your GM first, of course 😊
