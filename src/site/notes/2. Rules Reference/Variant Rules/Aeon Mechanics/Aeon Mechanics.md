# Aeon Mechanics

[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] are manifestations of esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]]. Their powers and capabilities are currently limited, but they may increase if the party can discover methods of empowering them. 

- [!] This page will update as the campaign progresses to reflect your Aeon's current abilities.

## Bound by Blood
Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]]'s life force is intrinsically tied to your own. Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] gains an additional 10 Hit Points. If you or your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] would be have your Hit Points reduced by damage, as a reaction with the concentrate trait, the other half of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] may take all of the damage from the triggering source instead. Damage cannot be split, and any special effects that would occur due to that damage (such as snake venom) still apply to the original target.

## Instinctive Communication 
Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] can telepathically communicate with you via touch. Additionally, your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] understands and speaks a language you know, and you can understand (but do not speak) one language that your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] natively knows; in both cases, this comprehension is strictly auditory and does not extend to the written forms of the language(s).

## Anchored Incorporeality
Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] only has enough power to partially manifest. When you manifest your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] they have the incorporeal trait, meaning they can move through physical creatures and such creatures can move through them. They cannot attempt Strength-based checks (such as [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple\|Grapple]]) against corporeal creatures, and corporeal creatures can't attempt such checks against them. Though incorporeal, your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] is anchored to you and can travel no more than 60 feet away from you and must maintain line of effect. This typically prevents them from moving through walls. Unlike many other incorporeal creatures, your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] does not have resistance to all damage or immunity to precision damage. 

## Emotional Surge  
Once per hour, as a single action activate command, you can open yourself to a surge of emotion from your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]], granting a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks as determined by their dominant emotion. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.
