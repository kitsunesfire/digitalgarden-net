# Aeon Mechanics

[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] are manifestations of esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]]. Their powers and capabilities are currently limited, but they may increase if the party can discover methods of empowering them. 

- [!] This page will update as the campaign progresses to reflect your Aeon's current abilities.

## Spiritualist Syzygy 
You can magically beckon a powerful being called an [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] to your side, serving as the mortal conduit that anchors it to the world. Whether your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] is a friend, a servant, or even a personal god, your connection to it marks you as extraordinary, shaping the course of your life dramatically. 

You have formed a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]] with an [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]], an entity that manifests in a physical body through its link to your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]]. You gain an [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] as well as the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Specialty Actions/Manifest Eidolon\|Manifest Eidolon]] activity, which you can use to manifest your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]]. Due to your (currently) rather tenuous link, you cannot gain or use tandem actions. Because you do not have Act Together, only you or your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] can perform an exploration activity at one time-- so, for instance, you couldn't both be searching or investigating at the same time. 

Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] is trained in unarmed attacks and unarmored defense, and shares your proficiency rank for Perception, saving throws, and skill checks. Likewise, you become trained in your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]]'s listed skills (see below); for each of those skills that you are already trained in, you become trained in a different skill of your choice. 

- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Sophia\|Sophia]] : [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]] & [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Occultism\|Occultism]] 
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Iain\|Iain]] : [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]] & [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Religion\|Religion]] 
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Val'Drah\|Val'Drah]] : [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Arcana\|Arcana]] & [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] 
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Yannik\|Yannik]] : [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] & [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Religion\|Religion]] 

## Spiritualist Spellcasting
Magic also flows through this [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]] from your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] into you. The nature of your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] determines the type of spells they may someday enable you to cast, should they regain enough strength to do so.

## Bound by Blood
Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]]'s life force is intrinsically tied to your own. Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] gains an additional 10 Hit Points. If you or your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] would be have your Hit Points reduced by damage, as a reaction with the concentrate trait, the other half of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] may take all of the damage from the triggering source instead. Damage cannot be split, and any special effects that would occur due to that damage (such as snake venom) still apply to the original target.

## Instinctive Communication 
Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] can telepathically communicate with you via touch. Additionally, your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] understands and speaks a language you know, and you can understand (but do not speak) one language that your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] natively knows; in both cases, this comprehension is strictly auditory and does not extend to the written forms of the language(s).

## Anchored Incorporeality
Your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] only has enough power to partially manifest. When you manifest your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] they have the incorporeal trait, meaning they can move through physical creatures and such creatures can move through them. They cannot attempt Strength-based checks (such as [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Skill Actions/Grapple\|Grapple]]) against corporeal creatures, and corporeal creatures can't attempt such checks against them. Though incorporeal, your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] is anchored to you and can travel no more than 60 feet away from you and must maintain line of effect. This typically prevents them from moving through walls. Unlike many other incorporeal creatures, your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] does not have resistance to all damage or immunity to precision damage. 

## Emotional Surge  
Once per hour, as a single action activate command, you can open yourself to a surge of emotion from your [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]], granting a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks as determined by their dominant emotion. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.

- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Sophia\|Sophia]] : Fury ([[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Intimidation\|Intimidation]] checks)
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Iain\|Iain]] : Devotion ([[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Medicine\|Medicine]] checks)
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Val'Drah\|Val'Drah]] : Confidence ([[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] checks)
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Yannik\|Yannik]] : Shame ([[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Deception\|Deception]] checks)
