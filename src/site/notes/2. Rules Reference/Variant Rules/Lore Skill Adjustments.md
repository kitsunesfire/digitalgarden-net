# Lore Skill Adjustments

- In general, this setting uses [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] skills more often and more liberally than the game typically expects. Because of this, I will often give you opportunities to scale up lore skills for free (so you don't have to spend a precious skill increase on them), and will frequently give out lore skills as rewards for quests or downtime. 
- I plan to do lore checks as *hidden* rather than *secret* rolls-- meaning, both you and I know the result, but the party does not. There are easy ways to do this in Foundry, and for those of you rolling in person, I am hoping to get a dice tower set up to make this just as easy for physical dice.
