# Rarity Adjustments

I'll add to this as I think of it; definitely a work in progress. When in doubt, just ask :) 

- Feats related to Fey Influence are Uncommon for [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Beastkin\|Beastkin]] ancestries  
- Feats related to Fey Influence are Common for [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|Malak]] 
- Ancient Elf heritage is Rare 
- [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]] is Common in Zarthura (but does not replace [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Veretian\|Veretian]] as "Common") 
- [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|Elf]] items are considered Common in Zarthura
- Any spell that summons a creature or entity is considered to be one degree of rarity higher than the listed spell (Common -> Uncommon, Uncommon -> Rare)
- Any spell that interacts with another plane (such as the Ethereal or Astral plane) is considered to be one degree of rarity higher than the listed spell
