# Signature Staves

At level 5, every full spellcaster in Sharum Mal'Kari gains a signature staff, which functions like a [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Weapons/Personal Staves\|personal staff]] with the following adjustments:

- Every character can only have one signature staff 
- Signature staves can be upgraded at no cost, as part of [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Automatic Bonus Progression/Automatic Bonus Progression\|Automatic Bonus Progression]]
	- Signature staves still must be upgraded with the assistance of the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/Staffcrafters Guild\|Staffcrafters Guild]] 
	- Signature staves are still subject to the standard costs and requirements for revision
- If ever lost or irrecoverably broken, a cost will be incurred at the GM's discretion; this cost may or may not be monetary
