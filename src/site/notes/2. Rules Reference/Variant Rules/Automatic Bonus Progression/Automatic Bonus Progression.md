# Automatic Bonus Progression

By default, this variant removes the bonuses to rolls and DCs usually provided by fundamental runes and replaces it with a new kind of bonus—potency—to reflect a character’s innate ability instead. In this setting, ABP does not effect the presence of other magic items that bestow item bonuses or other types of runes. Additionally, full casters and alchemists gain supplemental items to offset the monetary cost associated with their class progression. 

## Adjustments to Items and Treasure

All *fundamental* runes have been removed from this setting, and any item that would normally provide an item bonus to Perception loses that ability. All other runes and magic items that provide item bonuses are still present and function as written-- but of note, bonuses derived from potency and item bonuses are not intended to stack. This is mostly relevant to alchemical items, which may either benefit from potency or their usual item bonus, but not both at the same time. 

## Adjustments to Spellcasters

Starting at level 5, all full casters are granted a[[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Automatic Bonus Progression/Signature Staves\| signature staff]]. [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Automatic Bonus Progression/Signature Staves\|Signature Staves]] function like [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Weapons/Personal Staves\|Personal Staves]], except each character can only have one signature staff. [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Automatic Bonus Progression/Signature Staves\|Signature Staves]] do not cost anything to upgrade, but are subject to standard revision costs and restrictions. 

## Adjustments to Alchemists

Alchemists automatically learn higher levels of formulae that they already know (and have used at least once before) as they level up. Additionally, starting at 4th level, all alchemists are granted a pair of [Alchemist Goggles](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=408). These goggles automatically upgrade when they become eligible to do so.
