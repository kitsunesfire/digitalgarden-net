# Free Archetype

The only difference between a normal character and a free-archetype character is that the character receives an extra class feat at 2nd level and every even level thereafter that they can use only for archetype feats.

## Playing with Free Archetypes

Free-archetype characters are a bit more versatile and powerful than normal, but usually not so much that they unbalance the game. However, due to the characters’ increased access to archetype feats, characters are limited on the number of feats they can take that scale based on a character’s number of archetype feats (mainly multiclass Resiliency feats); a character may only benefit from a number of these feats equal to half their level, rounded down, as this is the maximum number of feats that could be used to take archetype feats without this variant.
