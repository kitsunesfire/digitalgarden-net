# Hero Points

In this setting, there are the following adjustments to how Hero Points are earned and spent:

- The number of maximum hero points you can have at one time increases from 3 to 5 
- All Hero Points reset to 0 when you make your daily preparations 
- Hero Points no longer reset when a new session starts 
- You cannot use multiple Hero Point options on the same check, nor can you use the same Hero Point option more than once on the same check

## Earning Hero Points 

- Gain 1 Hero Point at the start of every session 
- Gain 1 Hero Point at the GM's discretion
	- The GM is not expected to grant Hero Points in this way every hour of gameplay 
	- Some examples of how you might earn Hero Points in this way are included below:

- **Big Damn Heroes**: You may gain 1 Hero Point for fulfilling specific heroic fantasy tropes, such as putting oneself in danger to save another, prioritizing mercy, acting as a role model for an NPC, accepting the consequences of failure in an important moment, entering a new area for the first time, or completing a Severe encounter
- **Situational Awareness**: You may gain 1 Hero Point when you use your environment in a unique, strategic, and non-repeatable manner
- **Better Luck Next Time**: If the first action or activity on your turn that requires a check has no effect at all, you may gain 1 Hero Point 

### Examples of actions or activities that **can** qualify for Better Luck Next Time: 
- All enemies critically save against your Fireball 
- You use Double Slice and both attacks miss 
- You attempt to Climb but fail the check 

### Examples of actions or activities that **cannot** qualify for Better Luck Next Time:
- You cast Slow and the enemy succeeds but does not critically succeed on their save
- You cast Wall of Stone 
- You use Double Slice and only the second attack hits 

## Using Hero Points

The following uses of Hero Points remain unchanged: 

- Use 1 Hero Point to reroll a check you make. This is a Fortune effect.
- Use all remaining Hero Points for a heroic recovery 
- Use 1 Hero Point to activate a card from the Hero Point Deck 

The following uses of Hero Points have been added: 

- Use 2 Hero Points to make a non-ally reroll their check against you or its save against an effect you have caused. This is a Misfortune effect. 
- Use 2 Hero Points to reroll your d20 check as d10+10 (10 on the die counts as a natural 20, 1 on the die counts as a natural 11). This is **not** a Fortune effect. 
- Use 3 Hero Points on your turn to gain an extra action. You cannot use this action as part of a multi-action activity. 
- Use any number of Hero Points before making a check to gain a circumstance bonus to that roll equal to the number of Hero Points spent.
