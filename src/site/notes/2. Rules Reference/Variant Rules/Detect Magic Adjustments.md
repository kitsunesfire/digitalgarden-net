# Detect Magic Adjustments

The rules as written for detecting magic have a tendency to slow the game down and feel unsatisfying in ways that are neither fun for the players nor the GM. In this setting, the [Detect Magic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1485&NoRedirect=1) and [Read Aura](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1646) cantrips have been adjusted in the following ways:

- The [Detect Magic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1485&NoRedirect=1) and [Read Aura](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1646) cantrips are combined together; if you have one prepared, you are considered to have both prepared, as long as they are both available to you. 
- [Detect Magic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1485&NoRedirect=1) functions as normal, but if you concentrate for at least 1 minute on a specific item you gain the effect of [Read Aura](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1646).
