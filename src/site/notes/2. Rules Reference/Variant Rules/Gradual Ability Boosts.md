# Gradual Attribute Boosts

In this variant, a character gains attribute boosts more gradually as they level up, rather than receiving four attribute boosts at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels. Each character gains one attribute boost when they reach each of 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th levels. These are collectively a single set of attribute boosts, so a character canâ€™t boost the same attribute score more than once per set; players can put a dot next to each boosted attribute score or otherwise mark it to keep track. PCs also receive an attribute boost at 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th level (a second set); at 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th level (a third set); and at 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th level (the fourth and final set).  

- [!] When allocating attribute boosts, your key attribute may only be boosted at levels 5, 10, 15 and 20.
