# Spellcasting Adjustments

I'll add to this as I think of it; definitely a work in progress. When in doubt, just ask :) 

- Any spell that summons a creature or entity is considered to be one degree of rarity higher than the listed spell (Common -> Uncommon, Uncommon -> Rare)
- Any spell that interacts with another plane (such as the Ethereal or Astral plane) is considered to be one degree of rarity higher than the listed spell
- There are some additional [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Rituals\|Rituals]] that have been added to this setting
