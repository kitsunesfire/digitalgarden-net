# Language Proficiency

In Sharum Mal'Kari, settlements tend to be organized based on geography, not ancestry. As a result, [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] are generally formed regionally rather than racially. As a result of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]]'s legacy of control and influence over nearly all of Sharum Mal'Kari, Veretian is so common that it is regularly encountered in most places, even among those who aren't native speakers; for this reason, it is often simply referred to as "Common". All PCs start knowing Veretian (Common). 

Other regional [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] are considered Uncommon outside their region of their genesis. [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] that are uncommon are most frequently spoken by native speakers, but they are also spoken by certain scholars and others interested in the associated cultures. A character hailing from one of the regions with an Uncommon regional language automatically has access to that language; your home region entry states which Uncommon regional [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]], if any, are applicable to your region.

Additionally, there are also some languages that have fallen into obscurity and are no longer regularly spoken, though they still may still appear in ancient works. These [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] are considered Rare. Rare [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] typically take twice as long to learn as Uncommon [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] and are not learned by default; any character who wants to start with or study a rare language must first get GM approval. 

Having a positive Intelligence modifier grants you a number of additional Uncommon  [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] equal to your Intelligence modifier. You should choose these [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] based on neighboring regions and/or your character's background, subject to GM approval. If your Intelligence changes later on, you adjust your number of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] accordingly. It is also possible for your character to learn more [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] later on in their adventuring career. Selecting the Multilingual feat, for example, grants a character either two new [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] chosen from the Uncommon [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] list or one new language chosen from the Rare [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Languages\|Languages]] list.
