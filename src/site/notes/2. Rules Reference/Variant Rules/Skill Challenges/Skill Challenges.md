# Skill Challenges

[[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|Skill Challenges]] are a mechanic that can be used to represent narrative sequences -- often cinematic montages-- where success is not guaranteed and individual skill is required, but the core  modes of play may feel too tedious and get in the way of telling the story. They are a way to implement player choice and consequence into what would otherwise be extended periods of exposition, and most commonly come up while in [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]] mode.

While skill challenges are extremely flexible and are tailored to the specific circumstances of the story, they all follow the same basic structure and guidelines:

- Players will always be notified when they have entered into a skill challenge.
- Skill challenges track successes versus failures. 
- Skill challenges are collaborative, not individual. This means that each character contributes to the total number of successes and failures that the challenge participants have earned; a success made by one character counts as a success for the whole team, as do failures. 
- Successes and failures are usually earned by making [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Skills\|skill]] checks, with the following rules:
	- It is not possible for a single character to use the same [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Skills\|skill]] more than once within the same [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|Skill Challenge]].
	- It is not possible for a character to make an attempt for a [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Skills\|skill]] that they are not at least Trained in.
	- It is generally possible for a character to make an attempt with any [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Skills\|skill]] they *are* at least Trained in, provided they can explain how their use of the skill is applicable to the challenge at hand (subject to GM approval)
	- While each [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Skills\|skill]] check must be made individually, it is possible to [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Aid\|Aid]] your allies in their [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Skills\|skill]] check using the standard [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Aid\|Aid]] rules.
- Successes and failures can sometimes, at your GM's discretion, also be earned in other ways, such as expending resources (such as items or spell slots), or utilizing special abilities (such as activating an artifact or making a weapon attack). Such attempts may have a lower or higher DC than usual, depending on the relevance, permanence, and the rarity of the resource or ability in question.
- The GM sets the difficulty of the skill challenge by determining a) how many successes are required, and b) what the standard DC of the individual skill checks has been set to. For example:
	- A simple skill challenge could require 3 successes before 3 failures, with standard DC for most applicable skills.
	- A difficult skill challenge could require 8 successes before 3 losses with standard DC for most applicable skills, **or** require 5 successes before 3 failures with standard DC + 2 for most applicable skills.
- Regardless of how difficult the skill challenge is, if the group accumulates **3 failures**, the group fails the skill challenge. This value is static; there are never any skill challenges where less than 3 (or more than 3) accumulated failures results in a challenge failure. 
- Critical successes count as 2 successes, and critical failures count as 2 failures.
- In some high-stakes [[2. Rules Reference/Variant Rules/Skill Challenges/Skill Challenges\|Skill Challenges]], it may be possible to negate a failure by taking another type of consequence (such as taking damage or a negative status effect) instead.
