# Variant Rules

This category is for any rules that deviate from the standard "vanilla" Pathfinder 2e rules. Some are official variant rules, but more often than not are they are either house rules or homebrewed variants on official rules. Especially if you are already familiar with Pf2e rules, be sure to carefully read through this section to avoid any confusion. 

## Miscellaneous House Rules 

- The standard DC for the [[2. Rules Reference/Encounter/Actions/Basic Actions/Aid\|Aid]] action has been adjusted to be the same as the DC for the check that is being aided, minus 5.
