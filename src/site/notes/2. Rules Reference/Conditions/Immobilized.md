# Immobilized

You can't use any action with the [move](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=114) trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.
