# Helpful

This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is helpful to a character wishes to actively aid that character. It will accept reasonable [Requests](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=51) from that character, as long as such requests aren't at the expense of the helpful creature's goals or quality of life. If the character or one of their allies uses a [hostile action](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=300) against the creature, the creature gains a worse attitude condition depending on the severity of the hostile action, as determined by the GM.
