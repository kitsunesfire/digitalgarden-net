# Fascinated

You are compelled to focus your attention on something, distracting you from whatever else is going on around you. You take a –2 status penalty to Perception and skill checks, and you can't use actions with the [concentrate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=32) trait unless they or their intended consequences are related to the subject of your fascination (as determined by the GM). For instance, you might be able to [Seek](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84) and [Recall Knowledge](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=26) about the subject, but you likely couldn't cast a spell targeting a different creature. This condition ends if a creature uses [hostile actions](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=300) against you or any of your allies.
