# Grabbed

You're held in place by another creature, giving you the [flat-footed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=16) and [immobilized](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=24) conditions. If you attempt a [manipulate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=104) action while grabbed, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or it is lost; roll the check after spending the action, but before any effects are applied.
