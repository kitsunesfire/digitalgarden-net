# Invisible

While invisible, you can't be seen. You're [undetected](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=39) to everyone. Creatures can [Seek](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84) to attempt to detect you; if a creature succeeds at its Perception check against your Stealth DC, you become [hidden](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=22) to that creature until you [Sneak](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=63) to become undetected again. If you become invisible while someone can already see you, you start out hidden to the observer (instead of undetected) until you successfully Sneak. You can't become [observed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=27) while invisible except via special abilities or magic.
