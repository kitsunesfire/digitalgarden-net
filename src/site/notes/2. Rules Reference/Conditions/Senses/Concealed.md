# Concealed

While you are concealed from a creature, such as in a thick fog, you are difficult for that creature to see. You can still beÂ [observed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=27), but you're tougher to target. A creature that you're concealed from must succeed at a DC 5 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check. If the check fails, the attack, spell, or effect doesn't affect you.
