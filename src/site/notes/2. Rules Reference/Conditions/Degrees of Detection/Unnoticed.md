# Unnoticed

If you are unnoticed by a creature, that creature has no idea you are present at all. When you're unnoticed, you're also [undetected](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=39) by the creature. This condition matters for abilities that can be used only against targets totally unaware of your presence.
