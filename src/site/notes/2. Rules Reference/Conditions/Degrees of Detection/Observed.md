# Observed

Anything in plain view is observed by you. If a creature takes measures to avoid detection, such as by using [Stealth](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=15) to [Hide](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=62), it can become [hidden](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=22) or [undetected](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=39) instead of observed. If you have another precise sense instead of or in addition to sight, you might be able to observe a creature or object using that sense instead. You can observe a creature only with precise senses. When [Seeking](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=84) a creature using only [imprecise senses](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=412), it remains hidden, rather than observed.
