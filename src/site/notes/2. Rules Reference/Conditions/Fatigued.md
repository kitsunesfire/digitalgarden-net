# Fatigued

You're tired and can't summon much energy. You take a –1 status penalty to AC and saving throws. You can't use exploration activities performed while traveling, such as those listed [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=471).  
  
You recover from fatigue after a full night's rest.
