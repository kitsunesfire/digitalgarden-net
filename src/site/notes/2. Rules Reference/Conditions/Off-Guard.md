# Off-Guard

You’re distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC. Some effects give you the [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] condition only to certain creatures or against certain attacks. Others—especially conditions—can make you universally [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]] against everything. If a rule doesn’t specify that the condition applies only to certain circumstances, it applies to all of them; for example, many effects simply say “The target is [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Off-Guard\|Off-Guard]].”
