# Sickened

You feel ill. Sickened always includes a value. You take a status penalty equal to this value on all your checks and DCs. You can't willingly ingest anything—including [elixirs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=6&Subcategory=8) and [potions](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=15&Subcategory=18)—while sickened.  
  
You can spend a single action retching in an attempt to recover, which lets you immediately attempt a Fortitude save against the DC of the effect that made you sickened. On a success, you reduce your sickened value by 1 (or by 2 on a critical success).
