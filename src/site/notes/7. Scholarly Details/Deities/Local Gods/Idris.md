# Idris, God of Knowledge and Discovery

The god of students, Idris was once [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Abani\|Abani]]’s favorite pupil. He has always claimed that his divine purpose was to catalogue every lifeform on every plane, so that we may finally learn to appreciate and understand one another for who and what we truly are. Not satisfied with mere observation, Idris has been known to conduct a wide variety of experiments. In the past, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Abani\|Abani]] policed these experiments in their own ways… but with both now absent, Idris has been more or less “let off his leash” and has been free to do as he pleases. He is known to travel frequently, but he always ends up coming back to his laboratory in the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Cheongai\|Cheongai]] to work on his latest thesis.
