# Yamin, God of Love and Loss

According to legend, Yamin used to be the god of an entirely different portfolio, but his love for his partner was so powerful that it transformed him completely and he became the god of love. He is credited with being one of the first [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]] to arrive on Sharum Mal’Kari, alongside his sister Ba’raka. Though he has always been incredibly popular, Yamin has never had an army fight in his name and is typically not seen as a powerful god— though any [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Rioja\|Riojan]] will tell you that there is no god more powerful, no force more powerful, than that of true love.

Unfortunately for Yamin, his lover was mortal. Though he spent many long, happy years at his lover’s side, he has since been forced to live out his days without them. Riojans say that in their final hours, Yamin’s partner made him promise to carry on serving and watching over humanity and to never forget the wonder that brought him here in the first place. For many generations, Yamin did exactly that… but in recent memory, he has grown tired and weary. Nowadays, he wanders the world, destroying his own shrines and obscuring his own offerings everywhere he can in the hopes that humanity may one day finally forget him and let him rest with his lover once more.
