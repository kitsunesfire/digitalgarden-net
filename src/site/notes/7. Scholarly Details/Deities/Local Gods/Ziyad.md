# Ziyad, God of Reinvention and Second Chances

>[!grid]
![[Ziyad.png\|Ziyad.png]]

Very little is known about the true face or story of Ziyad, but their followers would say that is precisely the point. As the God of Many Faces, Ziyad is a god who is constantly reinventing themselves as their whims dictate or the circumstances require. Of all of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]], Ziyad is the most likely to cross paths with your average adventurer and have them be none the wiser. Ziyad is worshipped for a wide variety of reasons, though most often it is out of dissatisfaction with one’s current lifestyle or a feeling of stagnation and inevitability of an unwanted fate. While [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]] judges a person’s past and present, Ziyad is a judge of their future. Where some see mercy and benevolence in this work, others see evil running rampant and evading consequences.

Most of Ziyad’s followers are not independently organized; rather, they are equally likely to appear in just about any templar order, usually with their compatriots none the wiser of their true devotion.
