# Gayan, God of Wealth and Power

![[Gayan.png\|Gayan.png]]

By all accounts, Gayan no longer has any direct connections to Sharum Mal’Kari. According to legend, Gayan performed a mass sacrifice that killed nearly all of his followers and destroyed most of his places of worship when he created Tearfall— and those that weren’t lost in the ritualistic summoning were obliterated in the aftermath. After the All-Mighty ascended, it is unclear why he would have had any reason to return. Even so, his followers claim to have evidence that his presence still lingers here, tethered by some small strand.

There are some [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|dragons]] and [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragonborn\|Dragonborn]] that worship Gayan out of thanks for his role in bringing them to this world, and others that condemn him for exactly the same reasons.

One of Gayan’s most famous acts was the mass sacrifice of his followers which caused Tearfall. However, the nature of Gayan's mass sacrifice has been warped and misunderstood through history. In reality, what he had intended to do was create a massive miracle—gather together a huge group of people who were fated to die and subvert their fates, thereby making massive group of star touched to worship and empower him, eventually following him into [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]]. However, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]] stopped him... and in his efforts to correct the course of destiny, it was Sunan was the one who caused the mass execution, not Gayan.
