# Vandira

Unlike most other gods, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Vandira\|Vandira]] is rarely (if ever) worshipped in the open. Rites to the Lady of Thorns are typically performed in secret and seclusion, for the nature of grief is said to be a private matter only shared with this goddess herself.
