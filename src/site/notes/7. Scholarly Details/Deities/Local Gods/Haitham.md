[[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Haitham\|Haitham]] is the god of strength and victory. In [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] he is venerated as one of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Madjai\|The Madjai]] and frequently worshipped by soldiers and athletes. While he is commonly depicted with a calm, cold demeanor, The Blade from Above is also generally viewed as the most ruthless and fearsome of all of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Madjai\|The Madjai]]-- for once he has selected an opponent they are all but doomed to fall to him. 

In his mythology, he is often described to have a rivalry with [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Zoran\|Zoran]], for no matter how many times he cuts the god of conviction down he never fails to rise and challenge him once more. In some tellings, it would seem that [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Haitham\|Haitham]] has grown weary of this constant battle and takes no pleasure in defeating [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Zoran\|Zoran]] time and time again... but in others, he secretly relishes the fact that he finally has found someone whom he cannot truly defeat and is excited by the challenge. He is also often depicted alongside [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Orianna\|Orianna]], frequently serving at her side (or as her attack dog, depending on the perspective).
