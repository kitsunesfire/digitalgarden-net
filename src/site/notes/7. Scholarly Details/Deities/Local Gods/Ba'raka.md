Ba’raka and her twin, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Yamin\|Yamin]], are among the oldest and most widely worshipped of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Theos\|Theos]]. The War Maiden is credited with destroying the primordial beasts that once ravaged Sharum Mal’Kari, and has slain a great many creatures since then, seemingly endless in her drive to prove her might and rid the world of more powerful threats. She is said to favor warriors— especially those who are willing to engage in battles they know they might not win— and hunters who challenge themselves with skill, courage, and determination. Due to her nature, she is the god who has experienced the most frequent regeneration, so her depictions are varied and appear in nearly every culture of Sharum Mal’Kari. Little is known about her personal life, if she truly has one; by all accounts, Ba’raka seems only to live to kill.
