# Harun, God of Trade and Travel

>[!grid]
![[Harun.png\|Harun.png]]

Other than [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gayan\|Gayan]], the only Old God who is believed to have found a way to travel between this world and any other plane is Harun. As the Journeyman, Harun specializes in the space between destinations and peoples, and is often sought after to make those distances smaller and more safely navigated. Most of the myths surrounding the other [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]] do not involve Harun; it is very likely that he is more often than not the narrator of these tales rather than a featured player. He is often depicted as a hermit or a simple traveler, which may very well be how he chooses to live in this world. However, it is also believed that he is capable of making use of certain [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]] to travel to other worlds and send messages to and from beyond the Veil. The most famous of these points is the Burning Sky of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Varenveil\|Varenveil]], which when visible is thought to indicate a thin patch of the Veil that Harun manipulates into a pathway to [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]], temporarily enhancing the connection between this plane and all others.
