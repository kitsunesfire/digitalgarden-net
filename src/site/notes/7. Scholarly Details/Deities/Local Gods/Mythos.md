For many Zarthurians, the core concept around which all of their beliefs orbits is that of fate. This concept is often personified as a deity named [[7.

Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Cycle of Regeneration\|Cycle of Regeneration]]. 

Despite their diverse functions and associations, most [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] are thought to have one overarching role in common: serving [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]]'s will. Those that do not share this goal are typically represented as forces of disruption and are seen as threats to the universe.
