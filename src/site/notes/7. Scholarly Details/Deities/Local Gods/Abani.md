>[!grid]
>![[Abani.png\|Abani.png]]

Abani might not walk among the mortals anymore, but her presence is felt by nearly every living thing on Sharum Malâ€™Kari. She came to this world a teacher, with the intention to instruct all whom she could reach in the responsible use of magic of all kinds. In her prime, she was the greatest [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]] specialist the world has ever known, and it was from this wisdom that she discovered the ritual to convert her own life energy into [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]] and weave it into the Veil, mending the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/Rifts\|Rifts]] that [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gayan\|Gayan]] tore open during Tearfall. Whatever is left of her is said to linger in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]], guiding the departed to their final destinies.
