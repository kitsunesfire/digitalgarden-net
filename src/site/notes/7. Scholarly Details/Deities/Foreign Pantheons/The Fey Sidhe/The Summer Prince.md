The Summmer Prince embodies the fiery, passionate spirit of summer. He is supposedly the youngest of the four Sidhe, for whatever little this means considering their ancient origins. His bright intensity can appear warm and welcoming to mortals, but make no mistake, his curiosity does not mean he cares for them at all. He is jealous, vindictive, aggressive and even the slightest insult will incur his wrath. He is fiercely protective of the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]], and sees any attack on them, regardless of the reason, as a personal slight against him. He abhors the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]], and will try to find any excuse, any slight no matter how small to punish them. For this reason they are forced to hide during summer to avoid his wrath.

He appears as an eladrin of immense beauty, with skin and hair the golden color of honey. His eyes are warm but fierce, and he is always well-dressed and armed with his spear, Cu Sìth. The one thing that stands out as peculiar are his legs, which are that of a goat's, similar to a Satyr's. For this reason he is often assumed to be the first and patron of Satyrs.

## Seasonal Effect on Arcadia 

During summer is when [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]] is at its most vibrant. Everything has had time to grow and bloom during spring, and now the plants and Fae stand tall, proudly displaying all their colors and variations. But this brightness is accompanied by an open aggressiveness that is not normally present in Arcadian society. Some of the beasts even seem larger than during other seasons, bulked up and prone to short tempers. The Fae themselves are far more vindictive and prone to anger and this leads to more conflict within the courts as well. Summer is when the most duels are held, and when they hold entire competitions filled with grudge matches to settle any conflicts before they turn their aggression outward to mortals during [autumn](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/levantis-vastus/a/fiacha2C-the-autumn-huntress-person).
