The Lord of Winter is coldly logical, he calculates everyone's value by how much they can serve his needs. Unlike [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Fey Sidhe/The Summer Prince\|The Summer Prince]], he does not seek retribution for slights against other [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]; fey who get hurt or die were likely not worthy of survival anyway. When he makes a move, he calculates every step carefully so things end up as favorable for him as possible, even if it requires seemingly nonsensical orders or costs those who serve him dearly. 

There is another side to him however-- one of melancholy, one that resents how poorly his kind are understood by outsiders. How they are warded off or cursed. But as immeasurably old as he is, there has never been any change in this, despite attempts from others here or there. And this has left him bitter and merciless towards non-Fae, though not necessarily cruel.

He commonly appears as an exceptionally tall and thin, pale eladrin covered in a carapace of fossilized bark from long-dead trees. His eyes are black and wild, and his hair is thatched and white as snow. 

## Seasonal Effect on Arcadia

As autumn wanes and turns to winter, cold and darkness further seeps into the vibrant lands of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]]. The air turns frigid and unforgiving, trees become leafless and the land hardens before being covered in snow and ice. Winter symbolizes the end of a cycle, cold and harsh, but that is also something necessary for a new beginning. During these tough times, more than any other season, the usually individualistic Fae band together just a tad more to make it through the long dark. There are numerous underground burrows where the more summer-aligned Fae take shelter during this season. Even the plant-life seems to pull back, retreating further into the ground, waiting for spring to arrive.
