# The Mazzaroth

[[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Mazzaroth/The Mazzaroth\|The Mazzaroth]] are powerful, god-like [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Daemon\|daemonic]] entities as old as the universe itself-- maybe even older. Common myths describe their powers as originating from holy stars that reside within their ancient bodies, enabling them to manipulate [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] with its light, altering and destroying anything they please. If these legends about [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Mazzaroth/The Mazzaroth\|The Mazzaroth]] are true, they are likely to be the most powerful beings in the known universe. They are believed to have tremendous talents, not the least of which includes the ability to determine, dictate, and otherwise control the destinies of lesser beings. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Mazzaroth/The Mazzaroth\|The Mazzaroth]] are viewed as parasitic, as they feed almost exclusively off of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]]. It is unknown where [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Mazzaroth/The Mazzaroth\|The Mazzaroth]] truly originate from, as they are believed to have destroyed their own home world (and presumably many others) with their ravenous instincts, but nowadays are strongly associated with [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|The Abyss]]. Whatever their origin, they are seemingly un-aging and undying. Driven only by their base hunger, they have spent eons traveling the cosmos, conquering and farming off of the essence of other life forms that they deemed suitable... and destroying any and all who rebelled. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Mazzaroth/The Mazzaroth\|The Mazzaroth]] are not known to have any weaknesses, but are said to reach the peak of their strength on the solstices of every year. There is, however, one prophecy in particular that states two [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Mazzaroth/The Mazzaroth\|Mazzaroth]] shall hold battle at the end of the world. The two will finally kill each other, and the surviving world will be nourished by what remains.
