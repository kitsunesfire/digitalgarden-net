Also known as "Elemental Archons", [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Archomentals/The Archomentals\|The Archomentals]] are the goddesses of the eight [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]] and masters of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Malak Artes]]. Their power is tied directly to their realm (and vice versa), so it is completely unheard of for the Archons to ever leave their home realm. Instead, when the need arises, they tend to amass a collection of followers to act on their behalf-- usually [[Empyrean\|empyreans]] or [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|malaks]].

In Zarthura, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Archomentals/The Archomentals\|The Archomentals]] are called the "*Distant Gods of the Elements*", both because they are seen as uncaring for mortals and detached from their core pantheon of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]], and because their astronomers have deduced that the realms of the elements that [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Archomentals/The Archomentals\|The Archomentals]] hail from are much further away from this world than the celestial realms are. Still, some people in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] worship them nonetheless in order to gain part of their vast power.
