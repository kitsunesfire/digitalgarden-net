# The Neter

In Zarthurian mythology, there are four progenitor [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] who are responsible for having created the entirety of the known (and unknown) universe. These four [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]], known collectively as the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Neter\|Neter]], are rarely worshipped directly because they are thought to be far too distantly removed from their individual creations to be moved to act on their behalf. Even so, they are held in extremely high esteem in Zarthurian faith and offerings are usually left for them in local temples... just in case.

The Zarthurian [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Neter\|Neter]] are: 

- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]] - Creation
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Tenebrae\|Tenebrae]] - Void
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Kael Doras\|Kael Doras]] - Radiance
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]] - Fate

From the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Neter\|Neter]] emerge the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]]. These [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] are personifications of cosmic principles, laws, and forces of human nature that pervade the whole universe; they are the means by which the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Neter\|Neter]] sustain their creations and manifest themselves. Of these nearly infinite forms, the ones most familiar to Zarthurians have been [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|included here]]. The most important of these [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] are the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Madjai\|Madjai]]-- the six [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] who are believed to best represent the will of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]].
