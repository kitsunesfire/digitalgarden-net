# Deities

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] worshipped in Zarthura were traditionally grouped into one of two categories: either the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Madjai\|Madjai]], who were worshipped throughout the continent, or the local and common gods, who were only actively worshipped in a certain region or sometimes just a single town. Some of these [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] later became reinterpreted within a more widely spread pantheon of their own (see [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Pantheist League\|Pantheist League]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]]), but the original versions of all of these [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] have some key differences to those commonly worshipped elsewhere-- namely, they do not have a precise portfolio of specific domains. Instead, each typically exemplify or personify one or two specific characteristics or traits, as well as all of the complex and nuanced interpretations therein. They are also not associated with classifications of alignment, as these qualities they exude are believed to be able to be found in both good and evil folk alike.

The six [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Madjai\|Madjai]] are: 

- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Azaren\|Azaren]] - Spellcraft & Design 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Elincia\|Elincia]] - Freedom & Adventure 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Farrah\|Farrah]] - Bravery & Leadership
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Haitham\|Haitham]] - Strength & Victory 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Lothar\|Lothar]] - Beauty, Indulgence & Sensuality 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Zoran\|Zoran]] - Life & Conviction

and some of the most common or prominently worshipped [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] (among the multitudes) are: 

- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Balim\|Balim]] - Outcasts & Survival 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Lucio\|Lucio]] - Divine Retribution
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ziyad\|Ziyad]] - Second Chances & Reinvention 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Maymuna\|Maymuna]] - Family & Duty  
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Thelemia\|Thelemia]] - Revelry 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Vandira\|Vandira]] - Grief & Revenge  

Besides the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]], almost all Zarthurians believe in the power of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Fate\|Fate]]. In ancient times, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Fate\|Fate]] was not necessarily seen as a [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|deity]], but they were believed to be able to influence mortals and gods alike all the same. Because of this, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Fate\|Fate]] was often paid homage to and sometimes called upon during times of great peril. In fact, in ancient times, the continent of Zarthura was named "The Land of Fate" in part to signify the importance of this concept to its people. Recently, some prominent academics and priests have been pushing the theory that (contrary to these ancient interpretations) [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Fate\|Fate]] was actually one of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Neter\|Neter]]-- perhaps even the most important-- leading to new traditions forming around their worship.
