# Dark Sun

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Void Effects/Dark Sun\|Dark Sun]] is a [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] environmental effect that naturally occurs approximately once every season. During a [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Void Effects/Dark Sun\|Dark Sun]], the skies never truly brighten-- instead, nighttime persists throughout the day and the sun appears almost as thought it were a second moon. 

During a [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Void Effects/Dark Sun\|Dark Sun]], all [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] magic and related abilities are especially potent. [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Void Effects/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] is more prevalent and may appear in places it normally wouldn't, and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] is much easier to become contracted. [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]-aligned creatures are stronger than usual, and any of their weaknesses to daylight are temporarily nullified.
