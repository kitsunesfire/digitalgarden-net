# Solar Haze

[[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] is an environmental hazard that naturally occurs in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]-- especially within the territories of the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]] and the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]]. [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] in and of itself isn't terribly dangerous, but prolonged or concentrated exposure to [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] can lead to [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]]. 

### Visibility
As with normal haze, [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] imposes a circumstance penalty to visual Perception checks, depending on the thickness. 

### Fatigue 
Exposure to [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] causes most creatures to experience discomfort and fatigue, reducing the time it takes for characters to become [[2. Rules Reference/Conditions/Fatigued\|Fatigued]] from overland travel to only 4 hours. 

### Temperature 
[[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] causes the environment to feel hotter than usual. Characters treat the temperature of areas within [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] as one step hotter than normal (mild to severe, severe to extreme; see [temperature chart](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2768) for details). Appropriate warm-weather gear can negate this effect. 

### Sunblight Radiation 
One of the known means of contracting [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]] is a result of regular overexposure to [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]]. Any creature who has spent more than 1 month in an environment saturated with [[7. Scholarly Details/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] must make a save against contracting [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]]; your GM may ask you to make this check sooner if your circumstances would meaningfully increase your risk.
