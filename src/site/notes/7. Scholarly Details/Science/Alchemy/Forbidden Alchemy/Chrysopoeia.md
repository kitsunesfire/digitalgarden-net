# Chrysopoeia

In [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]], the term [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Chrysopoeia\|Chrysopoeia]] refers to the artificial production of gold-- most commonly by the transmutation of other metals such as lead. Despite being one of the fundamental goals of [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]], after some significant lobbying by The Honorable Society of the Brass Bell, the pursuit of [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Chrysopoeia\|Chrysopoeia]] (and all other currency-specific transmutations) was outlawed by the Guildmasters Association several decades ago.
