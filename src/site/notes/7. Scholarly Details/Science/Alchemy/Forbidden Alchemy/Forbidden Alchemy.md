# Forbidden Alchemy

While many aspects of [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] are widely tolerated (if not embraced) by the people of Sharum Mal'Kari, there are some practices that have been deemed unacceptable; this section describes such practices. Of note, the attitudes and views on what is "forbidden" reflected here are that of the general public-- there may be exceptions and/or amendments in certain regions. As ever, be sure to investigate and pay attention to local bylaws when traveling to a new area!
