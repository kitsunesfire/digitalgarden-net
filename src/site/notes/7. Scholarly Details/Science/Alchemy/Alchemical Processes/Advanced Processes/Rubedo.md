# Rubedo

Rubedo is a word meaning "redness". This stage represents alchemical success, and the end of the great work. 

Philosophically, the rubedo stage entails the attempt of the alchemist to integrate the psychospiritual outcomes of the process into a coherent sense of self before their re-entry to the world. This stage may take years to compete, due to the required synthesis and substantiation of insights and experiences.
