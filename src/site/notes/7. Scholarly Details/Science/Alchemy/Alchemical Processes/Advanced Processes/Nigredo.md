# Nigredo

In alchemy, nigredo, or "blackness", means putrefaction or decomposition. In this stage, all alchemical ingredients must be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter.

Philosophically, it also functions as a metaphor for the "dark night of the soul", when an individual confronts the darkness inside themselves.
