# Albedo

In [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]], albedo, or "whiteness", is the second of four major stages. Following the chaos of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemical Processes/Advanced Processes/Nigredo\|Nigredo]] stage, the Alchemist undertakes a purification in [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemical Processes/Advanced Processes/Albedo\|Albedo]], which is literally referred to as "ablutio"-- the washing away of impurities. This phase is intended to bring light and clarity to the subject. 

Philosophically, the albedo stage often corresponds to a shift in consciousness, where the world becomes more than just about an individual's ego, family, or country.
