Advanced, ubiquitous magic always seems to end up working like technology. Magitek is the emerging field of study that uses machines to pioneer new uses of magic. Magitechnicians are scientists that specialize in understanding how magic works. They tend to be mechanical inventors and tinkerers, since so much of magitek is only possible through technological experimentation. Most of them also advocate using technology to manipulate magical energy, with various goals. While it is not inherently evil, its purview of control over magic and possibly false life is a sensitive subject for many. Some magitechnicians even attempt to capture souls when a person dies, and use that captured soul to create a construct. Some regard this as attempting to disrupt the natural cycle of life and death, and effectively the same thing as engaging in the practice of Necromancy. 

The origins of magitek in Sharum Mal'kari are believed to lie in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Ansteigen\|Ansteigen]], though detailed records of its use and development have been nearly impossible to come by. This technology is not widely used in Sharum Mal'kari, but it is slowly being adopted and seeing more widespread use thanks to [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Falkor\|Falkan]] advancement.
