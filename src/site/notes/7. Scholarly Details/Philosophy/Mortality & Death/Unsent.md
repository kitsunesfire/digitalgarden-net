[[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] is a state of being in Sharum Mal'kari, and the common name for those that are in that state. When a person dies, his or her spirit enters [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]], either willingly by having accepted their death or with the help of a caster performing a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Sending\|Sending]]. If a person's spirit does not enter [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]], it will remain on Sharum Mal'Kari as an [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]], usually taking some manner of spectral form. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] are typically overcome by malice and often begin to resent the living; in the end, all [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] spirits eventually become [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]], though some [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] are able to retain a rational mind for a long time before they succumb. [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] can also willingly give in to the temptation to become a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]], and in doing so often become a particularly powerful [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Wraith\|wraith]]. Even before they become fully corrupted, it is thought that [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] can sense [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] and may even be able to communicate with them to some degree. 

Similarly, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] can also decide to [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Sending\|Send]] their own souls, no matter how long they have lingered before doing so. However, if they have become a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]], it is too late for them to be [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Sending\|Sent]] and they must instead be slain (again).
