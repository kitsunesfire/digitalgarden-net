# Holiness

A [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Holiness\|holy]] deity, being, creature, spell, or thing is considered to be on the side of celestials with a tendency toward goodness, and as such counter to [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Unholiness\|unholy]] deities, creatures, beings, and things on the side of fiends, undeath, and evil. A sanctified being confers [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Holiness\|Holiness]] or [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Unholiness\|Unholiness]] onto its acts and magic.

[[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Holiness\|Holiness]] is associated with altruism and assistance, and [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Unholiness\|Unholiness]] is associated with inflicting harm on victims. The two natures each hold a metaphysical form of [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divine Power/Divine Power\|Divine Power]] that is exclusive of and vulnerable to its counterpart.
