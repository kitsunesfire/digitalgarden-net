# Destiny & Fate

While closely connected and often intertwined, the forces of destiny and fate are considered to be separate and distinct. 

Destiny is a power greater than mortals and gods; it is a predetermined story that, while incomplete, concerns all of creation. All are bound to its will, for it it is the weave of the grand design-- something that is incomprehensible in both power and scale. The fact that even the most powerful of divine beings are powerless to the forces of destiny has driven many to attempt to free themselves from it -- or control it-- but as of yet, to no avail. 

Fate, on the other hand, is better described as a form of order. It is what determines the course of ordinary, mundane activity throughout the multiverse, and is what guides our everyday lives. With magic and great deeds, heroes and the gods may be able to willfully defy or redesign it to suit their whims-- but in most cases fate simply carries out the natural order of the universe as it is meant to be.

When assessing ones current circumstances, "fate" generally has more to do with the past and how one has arrived to their present scenario, while "destiny" has more to do with the future and what they are likely to do next. In many ways, an individual's fate can also be understood as karma: a consequence for actions taken. However, destiny is not thought to be able to be influenced by personal action. For these reasons, a person's destiny is often viewed as something that is set in stone and totally inscrutable, except by only the most talented of seers. A person's fate, on the other hand, is much more malleable and may be more easily read by trained shamans, diviners and academics.
