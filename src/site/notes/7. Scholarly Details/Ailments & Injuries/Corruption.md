# Corruption

The term "[[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]]" can refer to a number of different effects from a variety of sources, each with their own severity and consequences. Thanks to the efforts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Oleander\|Oleander]], one of the legendary [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]], it is now known that the root of most forms of [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] is caused by an imbalance or mutation of an individual's esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]]. While there are no known cures for [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]], it is now considered to be a condition that can be treated-- and even lived with, provided adequate medical surveillance, care and resources. 

### Abyssal Corruption 
The most common form of [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] is more properly known as "abyssal corruption", as it is characterized by an overabundance of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] essence within a subject. A creature suffering from abyssal corruption may appear ghoulish or undead, and typically has little need for sleep. In more advanced cases, they may even exude dark [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] vapors or toxic [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Necroplasm\|Necroplasm]], passively dealing void and poison damage to all whom they touch or approach. These effects may also gradually corrode the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] of their targets, causing the [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] to spread. 

Minor cases of abyssal corruption (or exposure to abyssal corruption) can be normally be treated with regular doses of a special alchemical formula made from the distilled essence of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Plants & Fungi/Dawn Lotus\|dawn lotus]]. However, once it has advanced to the point of mutating the subject, only way to treat this form of [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] is to alchemically alter the subject's [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]] to remove the excess [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] essence. In keeping with the [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Principle of Equivalent Exchange\|Principle of Equivalent Exchange]], it is also necessary to replace this essence with essence of another kind; it is an extremely complicated and delicate matter so as to avoid accidentally causing a different type of [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] in the process. In modern times, this art of [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy\|Spiritual Alchemy]] is the specialty of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]].
