# Sunblight Radiation (15)

Caused by exposure to [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Sunblight Crystal\|sunblight crystals]] or extended exposure to [[6. Common Knowledge/Natural Phenomena/Radiant Effects/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]] burns and dissolves the afflicted creature from within. The target cannot recover from the disease's drained or sickened condition except by magic. It is typically a 15th level affliction, but exposure to other forms or sources of [[7.

Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Sunblight Ward\|Sunblight Ward]], a piece of protective jewelry forged only in the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]].
