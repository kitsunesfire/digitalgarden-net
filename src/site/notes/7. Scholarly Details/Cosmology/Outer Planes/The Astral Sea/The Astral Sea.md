[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]] is a transitive realm that separates [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]], and has connections to all other realms. When a spell such as *dimension door* is cast, the caster travels through the Astral Sea for a fraction of a moment as they travel from where they are to where they want to go. [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]] is the most likely realm to end up in if errors are made in any kind of interplanar travel. As it is often the "dumping ground" for other realms (intentionally or accidentally), there are a great deal of strange phenomena and stray magical artifacts that end up within [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]], including the material remains of fallen gods and titans. 

Time does not pass in any normal sense while in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]], so natural healing (or decay) is typically not possible. It is also not generally thought to be possible to die by any natural means while traversing [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]], but since nearly all who end up here are already immortal, it is difficult to say for certain. 

In addition to the innumerable portals leading to and from this realm, there are four rivers that feed directly into [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]] :

- [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/River Acheron\|River Acheron]], the river of woe 
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/River Phlegethon\|River Phlegethon]], the river of starfire
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/River Lethe\|River Lethe]], the river of forgetfulness
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/River Styx\|River Styx]], the river of unbreakable oaths by which the gods and celestials all must swear
