[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]], sometimes called the Realm of Life, is the source of all life and vitality. It is a continuous eminence of energy that has been described as radiance beyond compare, life realized to the fullest, and power incarnate. It is full of life-giving potential, but object proof that too much of a good thing can kill you-- quickly-- for [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]] is not meant for mortals. In fact, despite its nickname, the Realm of Life can bring swift death to the unprotected by filling them with such intense, purified positive energy that they explode into a burst of radiance. As many unfortunate adventurers have come to discover, "positive" energy does not always mean "nice" energy. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]] is best known for the energies it exudes; any portal opened to [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]] is greeted with a flood of radiance exploding towards anything and everything in its path. Those caught in the wave are infused with energy, healing all wounds and increasing vitality. However, this is no clerical spell of healing-- the energy is unrestrained, and will continue to infuse the target(s) without limit, often inducing grotesque and agonizing effects of overexposure.
