[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]], also known as the quintessence, is the vast and timeless power of the cosmos, and may be the most powerful and versatile type of magic known to the multiverse. Its existence is known only to a few scholars and because of its invisible and intangible nature it is rarely studied or experimented with.

Most of our modern understanding of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] stems from fragments of research notes and folk tales left behind by the ancients. Their evidence suggests that the less [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] a being has, the easier it is for them to use and/or become influenced by [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]. This is part of the reason why beings whose [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] has eroded or mutated become known as [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]]. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is generally understood as a highly concentrated form of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] that permeates and forms much of the physical universe. It has been hypothesized that, in pure quantity, it is more abundant than any other form of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]]-- however, its effect on the material realm is much weaker than that of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aether's]] and is almost completely drowned out in the presence of equivalent amounts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]]. As such, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] only shows tangible effects when in large quantities, most notably beyond [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]], away from the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]]-rich planetary [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Meridian\|Meridian]].

[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is a form of energy that reacts to strong emotions, both negative and positive. Surges of strong emotion and willpower bringing strength to someone in their hour of need can be examples of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] in action. In fact, it is likely that most usage of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is performed entirely unconsciously, instinctively and unintentionally. The use of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] can also empower the casting of a variety of spells by bypassing the usual restrictions and reaching straight into the wells of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]], though it is most strongly associated with divination, luck, wishes, destiny, fate, and the capacity to alter reality. It has also been hypothesized that [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is the force that ultimately empowers an individual with [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Divinity/Divinity\|Divinity]].

[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is extremely difficult to collect. It is known to exist in many different states and forms, and is believed to naturally occur in the cores of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. Traces of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] are released from the body upon death, disappearing from the Mortal Realms to either merge with the chaotic energies of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] or become absorbed directly into [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]]. It has been noted that more violent and dramatic deaths tend to yield greater amounts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]].
