# Aether

[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] is believed to be the source of all [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]]-- and by extension, everything in creation. It is viewed as the source of all magic and life, and any disruption in its [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Anima\|flow]] is usually either the cause or indicator of major catastrophic events. It is said to exist within the planet and all living things, and while normally invisible, it may become visible when activated as magical phenomena or when concentrated in large quantities. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] can be "aspected" into eight known elements-- [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]]-- and drawn towards one of two polarities: [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Radiant\|Radiant]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]. In high concentrations, it may manifest in liquid, solid, gaseous or plasmatic forms (for example, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Aether Crystal\|aether crystals]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]], or [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Ichor\|Ichor]], respectively). 

When a living entity enters an area that has high, uncontrolled levels of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] (such as an [[6. Common Knowledge/Weather/Aetherflood\|Aetherflood]] or an [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Aether Crystal\|Aether Crystal]] refinery), the excess [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] may become absorbed by this new host. This process generally augments the creature (human or otherwise) in some way, and those unaccustomed to (or otherwise ill-prepared for) channeling this new energy are said to go mad. Additionally, prolonged overexposure to [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] may cause a variety of mutations in living beings, collectively referred to as becoming "[[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]]". Attempts to reverse these mutations have generally resulted in the total destruction of the being's [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]], reducing them to little more than raw [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]]... or, sometimes, even less. It has also been noted that creatures in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|akashic]] areas have demonstrated a tendency to become stronger and more threatening.

While [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] is considered very dangerous in high concentrations, it is otherwise seemingly harmless (and, in fact, if ancient scholars are to be trusted, quite necessary for sustaining life). It is said to naturally [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Anima\|flow]] throughout the realms of the cosmos, imperceptible to all but the most skilled masters of ancient magics. Places where it naturally gathers tend to be especially magically potent, and often end up becoming the seats of power for magically-inclined nations (such as [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]).
