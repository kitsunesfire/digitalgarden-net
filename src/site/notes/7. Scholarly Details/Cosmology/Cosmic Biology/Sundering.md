A [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] is a cataclysmic event that causes a super-sized [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/Rifts\|rift]] to form between a realm and somewhere else; in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], it is assumed that this "somewhere else" is [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]]. 
Nobody truly knows how a [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] is triggered, but it is assumed to be the result of some sort of eruption (or possibly the opposite-- a starvation) of magical energy at a [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]] point.
