What is referred to as [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] is believed to be a barrier that insulates the Material Plane and protects it from [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]]. It is described as tapestry of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]] itself, woven by [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Abani\|Abani]] from strands of all four [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] of magic and life, resulting in a bulwark of constellations that filters the energies of the other planes. The stories say that the power required to create [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] was so great that it cost [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Abani\|Abani]] her life to complete it.
