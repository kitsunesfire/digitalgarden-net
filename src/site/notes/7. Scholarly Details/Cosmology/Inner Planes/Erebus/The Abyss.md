# The Abyss

[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Daemon\|Daemons]] hail from [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|The Abyss]], a place of pure darkness for only the most corrupt souls. If [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Tartarus/Tartarus\|Tartarus]] is a realm of torture and systematic depravity, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|the Abyss]] is its twisted cousin-- a place where one can only find misery and despair in ample quantities, with neither the strictures of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Tartarus/Tartarus\|Tartarus]] nor the chaotic freedom of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. For evildoers who seek simply to inflict their wickedness on others, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|The Abyss]] is a rich hunting ground where one can revel in turpitude, though visitors be forewarned: the competition is fierce. 

In the most ancient myths, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|The Abyss]] is described as the primordial waters of chaos out of which [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]] created the ordered world(s). In later interpretations, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|The Abyss]] came to exclusively mean either the abode of the dead or the realm of rebellious spirits. In the latter sense, specifically, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|The Abyss]] has often been seen as a prison-- especially for [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]].
