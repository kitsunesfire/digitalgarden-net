There are four Courts in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]], each associated with one of the seasons ([[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Spring Court/Spring Court\|Spring]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Summer Court/Summer Court\|Summer]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Autumn Court/Autumn Court\|Autumn]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Winter Court/Winter Court\|Winter]]). Besides owing fealty to their local Lord or Lady, nearly all [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] have an allegiance to one of these courts; those that do not are called [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wildlings]], and generally treated as outcasts and sent to live in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Wyldlands\|Wyldlands]]. A [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]'s allegiance is usually determined by which moon they are born under; sometimes, however, there are exceptions. For example, an entire noble house may choose to pledge their allegiance to a particular court, regardless of the timing of their birth. 

The court to which a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] belongs tends to influence their personality, their [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|talents]], and their role in [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] society, though an individual [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] may or may not conform precisely to the stereotype of their court. The primary reason behind these seasonal court divisions seems to have been philosophical differences. This has led to a handful of battles in the past, in what one could call a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] civil war-- but once the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia\|Courts of Arcadia]] were established, territories were claimed and most of the noble families swore allegiance to one or the other; while conflicts still arise from time to time, an uneasy peace has been the standard ever since. More often than not, if a particular Court's armies are dispatched, it is to protect their borders from [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wildlings]] or to send aid to an allied [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|realm]], not to launch an offensive.

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia\|Courts of Arcadia]] all have central locations where they hold their local festivities, each equally beautiful and steeped in magic but uniquely reflecting the nature of the season. All [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] are welcome to join in each of the court's festivities, but the nobility and [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Archfey\|Archfey]] of the appropriate season are required to attend. During each season, the ruler of that Court becomes [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Sovereign\|Sovereign]]  and is the one who hands down judgements, settles disputes, gives gifts, and leads [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] armies. The nobility and [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Archfey\|Archfey]] generally defer to whichever court is in season, unless the matter at hand is directly in the domain of a particular court. For example, when the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Summer Court/Summer Court\|Summer Court]] is in season (or "ascendant"), the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Sovereign\|Sovereign]] of Summer would be the one to settle a dispute between siblings over the right to rule a domain. However, no matter the ascendant season, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Sovereign\|Sovereign]] would probably permit an Autumn Lord to judge a case involving a warband going rogue, as matters of combat tend to be the expertise of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Autumn Court/Autumn Court\|Autumn Court]].

These seasonal courts are, in theory, perfectly in balance, with no one more powerful than the others. In practice, however, powers within [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]] have risen and fallen over the centuries. It is not uncommon for seasons to be ascendant for years at a time, nor would it be unnatural for a season to only be ascendant for a matter of weeks. Since a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Sovereign\|Sovereign]], or leader of the reigning Court, can never be certain how long their influence will last, they are often very quick to make the most of their position. 

At present, this cycle of shifting seasons has been... stagnant. And while it is perfectly acceptable for a season to be ascendant for however long the Fates have determined, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Winter Court/Winter Court\|Winter Court]] has currently been ascendant for far longer than anyone thought possible. 

## Traditions Among the Courts  

While each of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia\|Courts of Arcadia]] have their own rules, forms of nobility, standards and beliefs, there are several ancient traditions that all courts follow and adhere to. These traditions have allowed all the various courts of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] to interact civilly, and are considered universal and unbreakable (except by [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]]). These include: 

### One's Word is One's Bond 

Once word is given, one is honor-bound to fulfill it, and all others are held to the same standard. An oath-breaker may be punished by death. Careful wording of oaths, however, can create allowances (also known as "loop-holes"), so one should take great care when asking [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] for promises, or when giving their word to a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]].

### Giving Gifts 

Unsolicited gifts are held with suspicion. A gift suggests an unspoken obligation to the giver, and is an especially grave insult if the giver is unknown. The price of a gift must be made clear upon giving, lest one anger the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]], even though an ignorant non-[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] might simply be trying to show kindness. If a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] gives a gift, there is always a reason; the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] is expected to make these obligations clear in some fashion or another.

#### Emotional Expressions as Gifts 

The only exception to gift-giving is in the expression of genuine emotion. Emotion, especially passion, are viewed as especially generous gifts, as they are given without expectation or necessity of reciprocity. [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] frequently show attachment towards those who have elicited great emotion, and therefore granted the gift of emotion. It is warned, however, that it is sometimes dangerous to attract these sorts of attentions-- especially among some of the darker [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]. 

### Acknowledge Beauty 

It is considered rude to not acknowledge the beauty of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]. Seemingly flirting at all times, it really is a simple reality of politeness and etiquette among the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]. Overt sensuality amongst the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] is, therefore, quite common. 

### Preservation of Peace 

In times of peace, it is forbidden for any [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] to deliberately slay another. Those who break this law are shunned and driven into exile in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Wyldlands\|Wyldlands]].

### Protect Lifebearers 

Many [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] place a high value on keeping their bloodlines "pure", which tends to result in most [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] looking down on half-breeds with other ancestries. However, historically low levels of fertility among [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] means that they will never harm either children or the pregnant, no matter how *undesirable* or unwelcome the match may be.
