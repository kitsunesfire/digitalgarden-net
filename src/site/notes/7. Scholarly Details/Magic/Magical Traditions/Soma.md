[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] is often described as life energy, and is the most common type of magic in the world. All living things are believed to have at least some [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]]; a being’s [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] is considered to be finite, as there have not been any confirmed methods to replenish spent [[7.

A common theory in Sharum Mal’kari is that adventurers have unusually high levels of soma for their ancestry, which is why they are able to survive when others cannot. 

The use of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] magic varies from region to region. The practice of certain [[7.
