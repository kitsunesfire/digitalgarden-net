Ether is occult, esoteric magic associated with emotions, souls, and artistic expression. Most of the records relating to [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Ether\|ether]] were destroyed long ago, so a lot about [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Ether\|ether]] has been left to interpretation. As a result, the few experts on the subject tend to fall on the fringes of Malâ€™Karian society, with their work rarely recognized as holding any real scientific or academic merit. 

In certain circles, however, occultists have found tremendous fame and fortune amongst parties interested in specific aspects of their magical work. This has been especially true as of late, with a sharp increase in demand for research into certain aspects of ethereal magic such as the afterlife, possession, reincarnation, soul binding, and spirits.
