[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] is the proper term for all forms of blood magic. It is used to perform a wide variety of rituals, ranging from blood pacts and sacrifice to prophecies, curses, and even certain forms of psychiatric treatment. The single most defining characteristic of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] seems to be that it works by activating magic latent in blood in order to generate supernatural magical effects.  

One of the best-known forms of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] is the Johtan practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]]. In previous generations, the practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]] by [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtan]] fighters held connotations of cheating or trickery, as its manipulative aspects ran counter to their warrior ideals of forthright, open behavior. However, this changed when Kings of Odessa began to learn and practice [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]] openly, and then credited those same blood magic rituals as having granted them crucial advantages in the field of battle. Even so, many traditional [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtans]] still feel that the practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]] is only a seer's work. 

In [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]], it is commonplace for their Immortals to regularly utilize [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] to empower themselves. The learning of blood magic has traditionally been seen as a hallowed rite of passage for warriors-- the fundamental difference between the common foot soldier and the elite. There is evidence that suggests that while [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] may have been popularized in the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]], it was the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] who were the first to truly master it and discover its potential on the battlefield. The fact that much of the rest of the world condemns the practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] has not deterred [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]] in the least... though the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] of Juruh Alealam *has* given them pause.
