[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Technomancy\|Technomancy]] is a technopagan magical tradition that is known to be incredibly abstract and difficult to learn. It is separate from, but related to, both [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Magitek/Magitek\|Magitek]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]]; where [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Technomancy\|Technomancy]] refers to magical powers that are gained through the use of technology, [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Magitek/Magitek\|Magitek]] is technology that uses magic, and where [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Technomancy\|Technomancy]] considers magic and science to be two parts of one force, [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] regards magic as affecting science, but not working in the same process. 

Mastery of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Technomancy\|Technomancy]] can only be gained from extensive scientific study and experimentation, which often requires the student to seek out sources both incredibly modern and unfathomably ancient. The result is a magic that is capable of not only hacking the underlying structure of the universe itself, but bending the laws of science and nature, weaving holographic illusions, manipulating time and space-- and, if necessary, blasting a foe into atoms. Additionally, there is no magic that is more capable of performing long-distance communication and travel than [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Technomancy\|Technomancy]], nor is there any individual that is better equipped to decode and decipher the various encryptions of the multiverse than a technomancer.
