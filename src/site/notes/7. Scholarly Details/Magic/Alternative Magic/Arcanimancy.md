[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] is the esoteric science of ascension. It is viewed as the pursuit of achieving spiritual transcendence through the practice of purifying oneself-- mind, body, and soul-- so that they may achieve enlightenment. Ethical debates have frequently surrounded this work, with some approaching it cautiously due to the potential risks of interacting with powerful entities. Others, however, view it merely as a means of inner transformation and self-empowerment.  

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] is highly mathematical and scientific, often representing a blend of [[7.

Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]]. To that end, arcanimists are expected to seek to transform "common" and "unwanted" circumstances into more "noble" ones. They often work to facilitate shifts from lack to abundance; from poor health to wholeness; from weakness to strength; from sadness to joy, and more. For these reasons, arcanimists are often viewed as saintly miracle workers and bringers of good fortune, though there are some who see their work as a "corruption of the natural order".
