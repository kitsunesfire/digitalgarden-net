[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] is the utilization of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Flow\|Flow]]-- the naturally occurring, latent magic that exists within and between all realms-- to cast spells and rituals that can manipulate [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]]. [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] assumes that there is an intrinsic connection between all living things, all of which relates back to the world in much the same way as the soul is connected to the human body. True masters of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] are said to be the stewards of entire planets, with the power to shift biomes, open and close [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]], divert and empower [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]], heal cosmic [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/Rifts\|Rifts]], and-- perhaps most significantly-- alter the very course of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]] itself. 

The fundamental teachings of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] include the recognition and honoring of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gaea\|Gaea]] (the "world soul"), as well as the identification of the universe as a living being. However, knowledge of these teachings has been fading... and without a new generation to keep the practices alive, it is at serious risk of becoming lost forever. Even in the scarcity of proper instructors, ancient scriptures suggest that, long ago, there may have been people who were capable of learning [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] more-or-less instinctively. Given that most of these accounts are incomplete narratives, however, it is also possible that these instances may be exaggerations or mistranslations. Nowadays, true practitioners are all but extinct; though [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] has existed for centuries, like [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]], there have been numerous prohibitions on its practice that have made it difficult (but not impossible) to study.
