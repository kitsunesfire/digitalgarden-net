# Cleansing (Ritual 4)

#Uncommon #Plant #Vitality #Wood 

**Casting Time**: 1 week 
**Secondary Casters**: 2
**Primary Check**: [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Nature\|Nature]] (master)
**Secondary Checks**: Geomancy [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Lore\|Lore]] or [[2. Rules Reference/Character Creation/Skills/Survival\|Survival]] 
**Area of Effect**: 6 mile radius circle centered on you
**Duration**: 1 season 

You cleanse the terrain of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] poisoning, causing the plants within the area to be healthier and more fruitful. If you cast it in the area of a [blight](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=4), _cleansing_ attempts to [counteract](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=371) the _blight_ instead of producing its usual effect. This ritual can be heightened to increase its area of effect, but this causes the primary caster to become exhausted for a number of days equal to the ritual level upon its completion.

**Success** The ritual takes effect.
**Failure** The ritual only takes effect for 1 month.  
**Critical Failure** The flora in the area changes in an unanticipated way, determined by the GM but generally as contradictory to your true desires as possible (for instance, blighting crops when you would prefer to enrich them).
