This ritual formalizes the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Triumvirate Council\|Triumvirate]] accepting a new member into their inner circle. Traditionally, the newcomer must be the one to provide the cost of this ritual. 

This ritual is only performed in the middle of the night, with the phase of the moon overhead holding great symbolic significance. When a subject attempts to [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Enter the Circle\|Enter the Circle]], the casters and the prospective member must first prepare a bowl of rich red wine while they dance, chant, and celebrate the occasion. One by one, each member of the ritual adds handfuls of the herbs to the mulled wine and says a short incantation to infuse their personal magic into the ritual. 

At midnight, the casters and the subject consume the wine together. Every additional caster beyond the two secondary casters increases the ritual's DC. The circle cannot support more than 13 total members. 

**Success** The subject is welcomed into the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Triumvirate Council\|Triumvirate Council]]'s inner circle.
**Failure**Â The subject and all casters are sickened for one full lunar cycle.
