[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Hallowing\|Hallowing]] is a complicated [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] ritual that extracts, implants, or otherwise manipulates the esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]] within a subject. The ritual is based on the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] beliefs that a being is composed of different levels of existence, from the sinful physical body ([[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Sarx\|Sarx]]) to the sanctified spiritual essence ([[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Ectoplasm\|Ectoplasm]]), and that these levels are interconnected. If the subject's [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] can be arranged and combined correctly, this can enable them to experience a "cosmic energetic transmutation" that allows them to ascend from those lower levels of existence into higher ones, eventually merging with Holy [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]]. It is a process of inner purification, transforming from one state into another state, from the profane to the sublime.

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Hallowing\|Hallowing]] has four stages-- one for each step of the alchemical process of rebirth and transformation. Techniques for performing the ritual vary slightly from one arcanimist to another, but normally requires specialized ingredients, designs, and circumstances, such as performing the procedure at certain times of day or under certain weather conditions. The ritual always involves material components that represent each of the four [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]]. Though the exact nature of the components are a personal choice that varies slightly from caster to caster, the most commonly used are:

- A meteorite shard ([[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Bhumi\|Bhumi]])
- Juniper incense ([[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Pavana\|Pavana]])
- Distilled water from a naturally flowing spring ([[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Varuna\|Varuna]])
- Specially carved beeswax candle ([[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Agni\|Agni]])

as well as special anointing oils that represent [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]. The primary caster also uses a personalized talisman known as a [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Spirit Locket\|Spirit Locket]] that has been carved with [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Runes/Astral Runes\|Astral Runes]] to aid in their casting. The effectiveness of the ritual is dependent on the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|arcanimist]]’s knowledge and skill level; loss of control can lead to a variety of unintended mutations and side effects. In most cases, [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Hallowing\|Hallowing]] results in some kind of permanent change to (or loss of) the subject's mind, body, soul, or life; this is believed to be related to the alchemical [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Principle of Equivalent Exchange\|Principle of Equivalent Exchange]]. 

Rarely, this ritual can result in [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Astral Binding\|Astral Binding]] instead. Very little is known about how or why this result is achieved, only that [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Astral Binding\|Astral Binding]] appears to compensate for the altered [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essences]] and enables both halves of the newly formed [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] to survive the ritual without any meaningful loss of self-identity. Subjects with this result are called [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Scion\|scions]]-- also known as "star-touched", due to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|starlight sigils]] that appear on their body after forming this [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]].

**Success** The ritual is successful, with unpredictable results.
