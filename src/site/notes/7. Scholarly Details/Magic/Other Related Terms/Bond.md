# Bond

A [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]] is a permanent link forged between two entities, usually as a result of a magic ritual. While very similar to a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]], the key difference lies in the nature of the connection-- while a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] transfers power unilaterally from one entity to another, a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]] flows in both directions.
