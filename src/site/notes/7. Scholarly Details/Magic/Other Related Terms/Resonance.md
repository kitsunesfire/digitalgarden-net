# Resonance

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] refers to a person's natural ability to channel magical energy. The entire population of Sharum Mal'Kari is believed to have at least some traces of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] within them. However, the level of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] an individual has varies greatly from person to person and appears to be related to genetics, with certain bloodlines seemingly predisposed towards having particularly high (or low) levels of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]]. In the case of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|malaks]], [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Malakim/Malakim\|Malakim]], and [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] few things go further towards establishing their formative identities, as [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|resonance]] is largely what determines which [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]] they use. No matter how anyone may try to alter their [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] is believed to be innate and therefore unable to be changed by training. 

Generally speaking, individuals with higher [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] are seen as more powerful than their peers, and may exhibit a variety of natural magical talents. It is usually easier for them do things that rely on magic to function, such as utilizing [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]], connecting to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Primordial Sources\|Primordial Sources]], or making [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] with magical entities.

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] plays an even larger role in [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] society, with high levels of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] an expectation of (and unofficial prerequisite for) nobility. It is distressingly commonplace for [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] royalty to disown their children that have not demonstrated a sufficient level of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]], and to adopt others who show strong natural talents. Equally, it is completely unheard-of for [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] to follow the leadership of someone with low resonance-- which is one reason why [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] often view societies outside their own [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia\|Courts]] with great skepticism... and  disdain.
