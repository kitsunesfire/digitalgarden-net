# Seidr

One of the best-known forms of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] is the Johtan practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]]. In previous generations, the practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]] by [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtan]] fighters held connotations of cheating or trickery, as its manipulative aspects ran counter to their warrior ideals of forthright, open behavior. However, this changed when Kings of Odessa began to learn and practice [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]] openly, and then credited those same blood magic rituals as having granted them crucial advantages in the field of battle. Even so, many traditional [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtans]] still feel that the practice of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Seidr\|Seidr]] is only a seer's work.
