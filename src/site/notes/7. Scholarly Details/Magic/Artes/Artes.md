[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|Artes]] channel primal [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|somatic]] energy from the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]] and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Primordial Sources\|Primordial Sources]]. There are eight types of artes: [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]], each corresponding to one of the eight [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Elemental Planes/Elemental Realms\|Elemental Realms]]. Artes are a result of this elemental energy interacting with the potent magics of one of the six [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Primordial Sources\|Primordial Sources]] ([[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sky\|Sky]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Ocean\|Ocean]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Earth\|Earth]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sun\|Sun]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Moon\|Moon]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Stars\|Stars]]), resulting 48 standard [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|Artes]]. The 48 standard [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]] are displayed below:

As a general rule all [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Apparition\|apparitions]] are born with an innate talent (or "[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]]") for at least two [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]]. Other beings (especially [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Elf\|elves]] or those with [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] linage) typically only develop a talent for one [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|arte]]-- if any at all. In some cases an individual may display an affinity for more [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|Artes]] than expected for their [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|ancestry]]; this usually indicates an unusually high level of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]]. 

The vast majority of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] belong to one of the four [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia\|Courts of Arcadia]], which also influences (but does not dictate) what type(s) of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]] they tend to develop:

| [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Spring Court/Spring Court\|Spring Court]] | [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Summer Court/Summer Court\|Summer Court]] | [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Autumn Court/Autumn Court\|Autumn Court]] | [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Winter Court/Winter Court\|Winter Court]] |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Water/Water\|Water]]        | [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]]        | [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]]         | [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Air/Air\|Air]]          |
| [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]]         | [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]]    | [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]]        | [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]]          |

[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] born outside of the court system, or "[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wildlings]]", may have an affinity for any of the standard [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]]-- more often than not resulting in bizarre combinations of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]] from different types.
