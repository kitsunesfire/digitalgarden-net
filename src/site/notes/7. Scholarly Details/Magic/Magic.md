# Magic

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|Magic]] is a mysterious, supernatural force used by many of Sharum Mal'Kari's inhabitants. It is exhibited in many forms, including spells and magic items, and is applied in many ways, including arcane, divine, occult, and primal practices. 

## Magical Essences & Traditions

Magical powers most often manifest as spells. Spells that are accessed by similar sources and interact with the world in similar ways tend to be grouped together into particular magical traditions. In Pathfinder 2e, there are 4 [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] of magic and 4 magical traditions:

Sharum Mal'Kari utilizes the same 4 [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] that Pathfinder does, though the lore around [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] has been expanded for this setting (see *[[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Principle of Materia\|Principle of Materia]]*). Likewise, [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|Reiki]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Ether\|Ether]] stand in for the four standard magical traditions of Pf2e (Arcane, Primal, Divine, and Occult respectively) and use the corresponding spell lists, though their lore has been tailored to specifically suit this setting. 

### Arcane Magic (Mana)

Arcane spellcasters use logic and rationality to categorize the magic inherent in the world around them. Because of its far-reaching approach, arcane traditions tend to have the broadest spell lists, though they are generally poor at affecting [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Pavana\|Pavana]], or the essence of soul. In Sharum Mal'Kari, arcane magic is called [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|mana]]. 

### Primal Magic (Soma)

Primal magic is linked to nature and instinct. It is an intuitive connection to and faith in the world. The cycle of day and night, the turning of seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey are what drive the primal traditions. In Sharum Mal'Kari, primal magic is called [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|soma]].

### Divine Magic (Reiki)

Divine spells are drawn from the powers of [[6. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Faith\|divine forces]] and are considered generally less dramatic and destructive than arcane spells, with a greater focus on healing and protection and significant variance based on the domains of the deity granting them. The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. Little is known for certain about the source of divine magic, how deities gain the ability to grant spells to their followers, or how deities can influence far-flung planes and creatures. In Sharum Mal'Kari, divine magic is called [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|reiki]].

### Occult Magic (Ether)

Occult magic is rooted in esoteric and alien knowledge of the multiverse's mysteries. The practitioners of occult traditions seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. In Sharum Mal'Kari, occult magic is called [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Ether\|ether]].
