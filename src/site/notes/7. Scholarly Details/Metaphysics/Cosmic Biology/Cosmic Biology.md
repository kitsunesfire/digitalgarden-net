# Cosmic Biology

Fundamental to the understanding of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]], the philosophy of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]] suggests that the planes and planets are alive. Such researchers prominently cite the existence of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexes]] in support of this theory. It is also a common belief that all [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]] has a [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Flow\|flow]], and travels in cycles that renew and revitalize all living things. In fact, one of the most commonly cited principles of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]] is the believe in a Universal Divine, "the root of all, from which all proceeds and within which all shall be at the end of the great cycle of being."

In [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] is a highly sacred place. It is considered to be a realm closer to the Divine than [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]], and it is considered to be an extremely high honor to be able to travel there, even briefly.
