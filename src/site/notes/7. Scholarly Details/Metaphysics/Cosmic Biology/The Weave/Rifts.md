[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/Rifts\|Rifts]] are unstable splits in [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]]. They are usually temporary and man-made, but hastily or poorly made [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/Rifts\|Rifts]] are better described as "tears", which may leave permanent damage to [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] that prevents them from from ever closing completely.
