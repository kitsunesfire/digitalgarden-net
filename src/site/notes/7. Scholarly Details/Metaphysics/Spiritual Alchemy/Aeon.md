# Aeon

[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] are spiritual projections of beings that manifest out of esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]]. Often viewed as "spirit guides", they are a result of certain [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] rituals, such as those practiced by the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]]. In most cases [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] cannot be perceived by mortal senses, except by [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|Spiritualists]] and others with particularly high resonance and/or specialized training. [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] typically communicate with each other (and with [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|Spiritualists]]) via telepathy.

For one reason or another, [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] tend to have a strong association with astral magic and celestial themes, leading some to believe that the nature of their summoning interacts in some way with [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]] (rather than [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]], as is the standard with most summoning magic).

## Aeons and Eidolons 

While similar in many ways, [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] differ from Eidolons in that summoned [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] are permanently linked via [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] to a [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Scion\|Scion]]. Previous attempts to sever this connection under laboratory settings have been catastrophic, usually resulting in a traumatic (and often explosive) destruction of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|tesseri]]. Following the [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Principle of Equivalent Exchange\|principle of equivalent exchange]], this loss of essence tends to trigger the eruption of a wellspring of chaotic magical energy as the universe attempts to rapidly replace the spontaneous loss of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|tesseri]].

## Aeons in the Celestine Church 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] believe that [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] are immaterial in their "true" form, and that the transition from immaterial to material is caused by flaws, passions, or sins. They would say that ultimate end for an [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] is to repent, undoing the sin of material existence and returning to [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]].
