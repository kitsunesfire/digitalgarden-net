# Sarx

A term used in the teachings of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] that refers to the earthly body and "sinful" human nature. They distinguish [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|soma]] from [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Sarx\|Sarx]], believing the latter to be the "seat of animalistic, immoral desires and thoughts", such as lust. They believe that it is the *spirit* that gives life, and that the body-- the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Sarx\|Sarx]]-- is useless, only providing temptations that distract from true [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Apotheosis\|apotheosis]] and ascension.
