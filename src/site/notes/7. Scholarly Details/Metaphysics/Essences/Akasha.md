[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]], also known as the quintessence, is the vast and timeless power of the cosmos, and may be the most powerful and versatile type of magic known to the multiverse. It is believed to be the source of all four [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]]-- and by extension, everything in creation. It is viewed as the source of all magic and life, and any disruption in its flow is usually either the cause or indicator of major catastrophic events.

[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] can be "aspected" into eight known elements-- [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]]-- and drawn towards one of two polarities: [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Radiant\|Radiant]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]. The use of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] can empower the casting of a variety of spells by bypassing the usual restrictions and reaching straight into the wells of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]], though it is most strongly associated with divination, luck, wishes, destiny, fate, and the capacity to alter reality. It has also been hypothesized that [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is the force that ultimately empowers an individual with [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Divinity/Divinity\|Divinity]].

[[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is extremely difficult to collect. It is known to exist in many different states and forms, and is believed to naturally occur in the cores of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies. Traces of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] are released from the body upon death, disappearing from the Mortal Realms to either merge with the chaotic energies of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] or become absorbed directly into the Celestial Realms.  It has been noted that more violent and dramatic deaths tend to yield greater amounts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]. 

When a living entity enters an area that has high concentrations of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]], the excess [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] may become absorbed by this new host. This process generally augments the creature (human or otherwise) in some way, and those unaccustomed to (or otherwise ill-prepared for) channeling this new energy are said to go mad. Additionally, overexposure to [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] may cause a variety of mutations in living beings. Attempts to reverse these mutations have generally resulted in the total destruction of the being's essence, reducing them to little more than raw [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]]... or, sometimes, even less. It has also been noted that creatures in [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|akashic]] areas have demonstrated a tendency to become stronger and more threatening.

While [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] is considered very dangerous in high concentrations, it is otherwise seemingly harmless (and, in fact, if ancient scholars are to be trusted, quite necessary for sustaining life). It is said to naturally flow throughout the realms of the cosmos, imperceptible to all but the most skilled masters of ancient magics. Places where it naturally gathers tend to be especially magically potent, and often end up becoming the seats of power for magically-inclined nations.
