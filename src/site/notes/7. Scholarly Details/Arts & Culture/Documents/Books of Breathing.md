# Books of Breathing

The Books of Breathing are several ancient funerary texts intended to enable deceased people to continue existing in the afterlife. Their titles use the word "breathing" as a metaphorical term for all of the aspects of life that the deceased hoped to experience again in the afterlife. The texts include descriptions of various ways one might appease [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Madjai\|The Madjai]] to accept the deceased into their company. 

These books are believed to have been written by and for ancient Zarthurian [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Espers\|Espers]]. In recognition of their lifetime of devotion and service, an abridged version of these books, often referred to as a "Breathing Permit", was often buried with a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Espers\|Espers]] as part of their final rites. The Breathing Permit was intended to assist the owner in navigating the afterlife, being judged worthy and living forever.
