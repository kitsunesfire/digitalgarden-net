# Book of Gates

The Book of Gates is long and detailed, consisting of over one hundred chapters. It narrates the passage of a newly deceased soul into the afterlife, journeying with the god of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Radiant\|radiance]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Kael Doras\|Kael Doras]], through [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]] during "the hours of night" towards their [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Resurrection\|Resurrection]]. 

The soul is required to pass through a series of 'gates' at each 'hour' of the journey. Each gate is guarded by a different [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|draconic]] entity that is associated with a different [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|deity]]. It is important that the deceased knows the names of each guardian. Depictions of the judgement of the dead are shown in the descriptions of the last three hours. 

The final sections of the text imply that some people will pass through unharmed, but others will suffer the torment of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Tartarus/Tartarus\|Tartarus]] or fall into an endless [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|abyss]]. At the end of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Kael Doras\|Kael Doras]]'s journey through [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]], he emerges anew to take his place back in the sky.
