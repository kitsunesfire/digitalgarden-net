# Tablets of Heaven

It is a group of books that include commentary on many mystical aspects of the multiverse, such as the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls and redemption, and meditations on the themes of personal light and darkness. 

There are five books confirmed to exist in this collection, though the incomplete nature of the parables suggest that either some of the text was never properly translated or that there may be entire books still missing from the chronicle. 

- The first book is said to describe the fall of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]], the radiant divinities that created the first [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|seraphs]]. 
- The second book themed around astronomical events, and goes into great detail regarding the life cycle of stars and planets. 
- The third book is the Book of Dreams, which contains simultaneous, synesthetic visions of the past, present, and future that are nearly impossible for mortals to behold without going mad. 
- The fourth book, and perhaps the most famous, is the Book of Souls, which describes the constituent parts of a soul and provides commentary on how to maintain a healthy soul.
- The fifth book is extremely poetic in nature and has had many interpretations and translations over the years, but is considered to be one of the most beautiful works of writing on the subject of inner turmoil and salvation.
