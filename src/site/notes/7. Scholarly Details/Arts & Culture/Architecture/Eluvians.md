[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvians\|Eluvians]] are magical portals that can only be constructed in places of potent magical potential. In ancient times, they were used to communicate and travel great distances, both across and within planes. Many [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvians\|Eluvians]] once existed across the landscape of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], but a combination of war, neglect, and carelessness has led to the loss and destruction of all but a few. Those that remain are typically extremely well guarded and honored as shrines unto themselves. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvians\|Eluvians]] are activated using an [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Eluvian Keys\|Eluvian Key]], which can sometimes be a physical token but might also be a password, a piece of music, a spell, or a specific stellar conjunction. Only the first traveler in a group needs a key; the rest can follow through to the same destination. Some gates have multiple keys, each linked to another specific eluvian. Most eluvian keys have been forgotten over time, and therefore, some [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvians\|Eluvians]] are believed to have become completely inaccessible. 

There are some individuals, such as certain psychopomps, who are gifted with abilities that allow them to open [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvians\|Eluvians]] without the need of a key. Additionally, there are legends that suggest it is possible for true love (and true hate) to be able to force open an [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvians\|eluvian]]-- though this is the stuff of Riojan mythology and likely greatly exaggerated if not entirely untrue.
