# Crown Contest

Under normal circumstances, upon either the death or abdication of a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]], there is a competition called the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] held between [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|candidates]] for the throne-- usually including many (if not all) of the members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]. 

During the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], it is customary for each of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] to issue a trial to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|candidates]]-- either to prove or to challenge their worthiness. While the trials are intended to be designed to evaluate the candidate's suitability as a leader, there are no formal regulations on what the trial should or should not be. Therefore, if the candidate is highly favored by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]], they are free to decree an extraordinarily simple task-- or the inverse, should the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] wish to see the candidate fail. Even so, the trials are also meant to serve as an opportunity for the candidate to show off and earn public favor, so setting too easy of a task can backfire as it may imply that the candidate is incapable of greater accomplishment or needs assistance, or that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] is undemanding and easy to impress. Likewise, it is a risk for a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] to appoint a highly challenging task that they intend for the candidate to fail, because if the candidate manages to overcome the odds they are far more likely to gain public support and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] will then have a great deal of pressure on them to support the candidate regardless of their personal feelings-- not to mention these kinds of rigged trials are often seen for what they are and strongly disliked by the public, which may result in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] either resigning or being forcibly replaced once the candidate has ascended to the throne. 

At the conclusion of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], a winner is chosen. This individual becomes the new heir apparent to the Zarthurian throne, who is then presented to the public in an elaborate ceremony that marks the official start of their rule. In [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], this final step of confirmation is called "ascension".
