# Crown Contest

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Succession to the Crown Act\|Succession to the Crown Act]] established the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], a competition held between [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|candidates]] for the throne. A [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] can be initiated either by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] or by a unanimous vote amongst the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]]; if it is initiated by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] it is typically seen as an abdication of the throne, but if it is initiated by the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]] it is generally seen as a vote of no confidence with the current [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]. 

At its core, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] is always an intense, multi-faceted test of Zarthurian values: power, leadership, grace, elegance, and conviction. A true Zarthurian is said to be equally at home on the battlefield and the ballroom, and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] is meant to ensure that their future leader can excel in all arenas and faithfully represent their people. 

During the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], it is customary for each of the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]] to issue a trial to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|candidates]]-- either to prove or to challenge their worthiness. While the trials are intended to be designed to evaluate the candidate's suitability as a leader, there are no formal regulations on what the trial should or should not be. Therefore, if the candidate is highly favored by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]], they are free to decree an extraordinarily simple task-- or the inverse, should the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] wish to see the candidate fail. Even so, the trials are also meant to serve as an opportunity for the candidate to show off and earn public favor, so setting too easy of a task can backfire as it may imply that the candidate is incapable of greater accomplishment or needs assistance, or that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] is undemanding and easy to impress. Likewise, it is a risk for a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] to appoint a highly challenging task that they intend for the candidate to fail, because if the candidate manages to overcome the odds they are far more likely to gain public support and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] will then have a great deal of pressure on them to support the candidate regardless of their personal feelings-- not to mention these kinds of rigged trials are often seen for what they are and strongly disliked by the public, which may result in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] either resigning or being forcibly replaced once the candidate has ascended to the throne. 

Since the particulars of each challenge within the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] are decided by the sitting members of the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]], each one is different from the next. This also means that sometimes the Contest can be completed rather quickly (in, say, a matter of weeks) while others can take significantly longer. Once the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] has been completed, the victor (also known as the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]]) is confirmed by and for their public in an elaborate ceremony that marks the official start of their rule. In [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], this final step of confirmation is called "ascension".
