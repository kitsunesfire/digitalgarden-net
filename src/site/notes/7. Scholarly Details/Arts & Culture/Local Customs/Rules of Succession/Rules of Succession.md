# Rules of Succession

Prior to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Succession to the Crown Act\|Succession to the Crown Act]], there was no permanent, standardized procedure in Zarthurian law for a successor to be determined--  the reigning [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] typically either appointed a successor themselves or was forcibly replaced by one. However, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Succession to the Crown Act\|Succession to the Crown Act]] established new regulations in three areas: the process of determining a successor to the throne, the expected duration of a monarch's rule, and some provisionary measures for when the above should fail. 

## Determining a Successor to the Throne

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Succession to the Crown Act\|Succession to the Crown Act]] established the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], a competition held between [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|candidates]] for the throne. A [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] can be initiated either by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] or by a unanimous vote amongst the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]]; if it is initiated by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] it is typically seen as an abdication of the throne, but if it is initiated by the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]] it is generally seen as a vote of no confidence with the current [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]. 

At its core, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] is always an intense, multi-faceted test of Zarthurian values: power, leadership, grace, elegance, and conviction. A true Zarthurian is said to be equally at home on the battlefield and the ballroom, and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] is meant to ensure that their future leader can excel in all arenas and faithfully represent their people. 

Since the particulars of each challenge within the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] are decided by the sitting members of the [[5. Factions/The Eternian Government/The Ennead/The Ennead\|The Ennead]], each one is different from the next. This also means that sometimes the Contest can be completed rather quickly (in, say, a matter of weeks) while others can take significantly longer. Once the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Rules of Succession/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] has been completed, the victor (also known as the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]]) is confirmed by and for their public in an elaborate ceremony that marks the official start of their rule. In [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], this final step of confirmation is called "ascension".
