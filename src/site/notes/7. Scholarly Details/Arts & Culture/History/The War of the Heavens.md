# The War of the Heavens

A long, brutal and bloody war fought between the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|high elves]] of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] and the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]] of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. Many accounts blame [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] for having summoned demons into [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] in the first place, which is said to have lead to the first of many portals opening between the two realms. One such portal is known to open and active to this day-- [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Mors Omnia/Mors Omnia\|Mors Omnia]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]].
