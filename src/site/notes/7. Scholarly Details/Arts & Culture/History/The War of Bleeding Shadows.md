# The War of Bleeding Shadows

Also known as the "[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] Civil War", [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]] was a violent and brutal war that shattered the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]] and nearly destroyed the whole of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. As with any war, the true motivations and causes are difficult to isolate, but the spark that lit the powder keg of revolution was the assassination of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Wulfram von Durchenwald\|Wulfram von Durchenwald]] (the "Red Kaiser") by one of his own men-- a fellow [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] by the name of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Luthis Sandor\|Luthis Sandor]], whose actions and ideals would later inspire the founding of the rebellious [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Republican\|Republican]] faction. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]] is one of the most horrific wars on record in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]'s history. Countless war crimes were committed, largely because Zarthurian law does not codify war crimes in the same way that the main continent does, so much was able to be done with complete impunity. Many of the details of what exactly occurred likely died with the mass casualties, but the events of this war lead to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]] and nearly drove the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] into extinction. In the end, the war was won by [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Silas\|Silas Braska]], who then declared himself not [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] but [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] as he pledged to continue his conquest and re-introduce [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] to the world's stage as the mighty, timeless, and unending [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Empire of Eternia]].
