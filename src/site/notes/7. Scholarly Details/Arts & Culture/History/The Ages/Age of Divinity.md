# Age of Divinity

- 0 AD to 972 AD
- Duration: 972 years

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Divinity\|Age of Divinity]] began when [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]] made themselves known to the people of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. Their earliest worshippers established the system of [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Anno Domini\|Anno Domini]]-- the [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Calendar & Clock\|calendar]] system still universally used to this day-- and for this reason the beginning of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Divinity\|Age of Divinity]] is seen as "year zero" in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]'s history. 

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Divinity\|Age of Divinity]] ended when [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gayan\|Gayan]] ripped open [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] and caused the Tearfall to descend upon [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], thus initiating the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Dragons\|Age of Dragons]].
