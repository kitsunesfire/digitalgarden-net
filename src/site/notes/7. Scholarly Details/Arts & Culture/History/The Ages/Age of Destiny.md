# Age of Destiny

Zara has recently confirmed the next Age will be named the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Destiny\|Age of Destiny]]. Her ominous prediction is that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Destiny\|Age of Destiny]] will soon begin and that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Ascension\|Age of Ascension]] nearing its end. Since thus far in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]'s history there has yet to be a seamless or peaceful transition between Ages, this is commonly viewed as a signal of imminent calamity in at least some part of the world. All anyone can do is hope that it happens somewhere far from their own backyard.
