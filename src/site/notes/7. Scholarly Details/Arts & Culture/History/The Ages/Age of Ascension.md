# Age of Ascension

- 1441 AD to present (1452 AD)
- Duration: 11 years (so far)
- Anticipated duration: approximately 14 years

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Ascension\|Age of Ascension]] began after the [[5.

Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Destiny\|Age of Destiny]], and her prediction is that this new Age will begin soon, signaling that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Ascension\|Age of Ascension]] is rapidly nearing its end-- one way, or another. This has shocked historians, for if this prediction turns out to be true, it would make the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Ascension\|Age of Ascension]] the shortest in history. Not only that, but more alarmingly, in all of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]'s history there has yet to be a seamless or peaceful transition between Ages, so this is likely a signal of some sort of calamity soon to come...
