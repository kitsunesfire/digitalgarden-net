# Age of Antiquity

- Duration: unclear; estimated around 3,000 years

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Antiquity\|Age of Antiquity]] refers to the period of history before the recorded presence or influence of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] on [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. It is the oldest Age that is acknowledged and agreed upon by historians, and considered to encompass about 3,000 years of primordial development after the universe began. 

Very few artifacts from this time have survived, but from what little traces remain some very skilled historians have managed to draw certain inferences about how life might have been for [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]'s earliest inhabitants. For instance, there is evidence to suggest that most if not all of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Human\|humanity]] can trace their origins to the clans of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]], and that there may be a common ancestral link between [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Human\|humans]] and [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Dwarf\|dwarves]]. 

Though the exact duration of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Antiquity\|Age of Antiquity]] is not agreed upon, it is generally considered to have ended in [[6. Common Knowledge/Calendar & Clock/Anno Domini\|Anno Domini]]-- the first calendar year, marked by the arrival of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]], which also began the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Divinity\|Age of Divinity]].
