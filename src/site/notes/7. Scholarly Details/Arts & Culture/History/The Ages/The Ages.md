# The Ages

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/The Ages\|The Ages]] refer to periods of time in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/History\|History]] of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. As she begins to sense the end of an Age approaching, the coming Age is predicted and named by [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Zara\|Zara]], a crystal [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|Dragon]] who currently rules over [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Heartrest\|Heartrest]] and is considered to be the world's most powerful seer.

Historians have noted that each progressive Age appears to be getting exponentially shorter as time goes on, but no reason behind this phenomena has as of yet been determined.
