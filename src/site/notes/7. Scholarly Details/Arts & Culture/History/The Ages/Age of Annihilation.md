# Age of Annihilation

- 1405 AD to 1440 AD
- Duration: 36 years

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]] came after the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Arcana\|Age of Arcana]] and was followed by our current Age, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Ascension\|Age of Ascension]]. The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]] is famous as the Age when [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] ran rampant throughout the mainland of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] and nearly consumed its entire population. Were it not for the bravery of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]], it is likely that the world as we know it would have ceased to exist. 

Elsewhere in the world, [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] remembers the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]] as a time of devastating civil war and upheaval. Though [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], thanks to their experimental medicines and ancient rituals, was able to avoid the worst of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] pandemic that shattered the rest of the world, they ended up falling into their own self-made despair when [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]] tore their nation apart. Sparked by the assassination of their [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]] set ablaze the ethnic and political tensions that had long-since been brewing and became one of the longest, most brutal instances of warfare the world has ever seen-- though, largely due to Zarthura's insular and private nature, most of the rest of the world had no idea what was happening or the true extent of the violence that was occurring. 

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]] is considered to have ended when the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]] restored the [[7. Scholarly Details/Philosophy/Mortality & Death/Cycle of Regeneration\|Cycle of Regeneration]], defeated the leader of the Wild Hunt,  and repaired [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]], effectively sealing the world and saving it from extraplanar threats both current and future. This new stability and hope ushered in a new Age of relative peace and prosperity called the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Ascension\|Age of Ascension]]. However, in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], this transition was hardly noticed or recognized, for in their nation war still continued to rage on for another decade.
