# Age of Arcana

- 1297 AD to 1404 AD
- Duration: 108 years

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Arcana\|Age of Arcana]] began as the fallen Dragon Lords became replaced by human nobility, who took these broken lands and used them to form nations and kingdoms of their own. Almost immediately, the race began to be the first to fill the power vacuum left behind by the destruction of dragons, with each newborn nation scrambling to replicate the very strength they so recently tore asunder. This arms race quickly turned to matters of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]] (which up until this point in history had been viewed exclusively as the magic of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|dragons]] and therefore had been forbidden to practice), and led to remarkable breakthroughs in fields such as [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Magitek/Magitek\|Magitek]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]]. 

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Arcana\|Age of Arcana]] is considered to have ended when, at the conclusion of the Tournament of Heartrest, one of its [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Champions of Heartrest/Champions of Heartrest\|Champions]] Wished for much of this progress to be undone. The magnitude of this Wish caused tremendous strain on the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]] of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], indirectly causing and worsening various tears in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] and leaving the world vulnerable to the effects of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] beyond. These effects-- collectively referred to as [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]]-- came to define the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]].
