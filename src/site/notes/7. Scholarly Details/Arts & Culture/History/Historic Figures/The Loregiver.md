Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Fate\|Fate]], was one of the most prominent figures in ancient Zarthurian history, though some believe her to be nothing more than a myth. 

The stories say that [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Fate\|Fate]] chose a beautiful young girl unto whom to bestow their knowledge. This girl, who was later called [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/The Loregiver\|The Loregiver]], penned the sacred scrolls that would one day become the basis for the [[_.
