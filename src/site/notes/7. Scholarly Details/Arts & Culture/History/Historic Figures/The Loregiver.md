# The Loregiver

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/The Loregiver\|The Loregiver]], also called the Handmaiden of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]], was one of the most prominent figures in ancient Zarthurian [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/History\|history]], though some believe her to be nothing more than a myth. 

The stories say that [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]] chose a beautiful woman unto whom to bestow their knowledge. This woman, who was later called [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/The Loregiver\|The Loregiver]], penned the sacred scrolls that would one day become the basis for the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]]. She hid the scrolls within a secret cave in the mountains of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], knowing full well that the people of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] were not ready to receive the wisdom of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]]. The scrolls were found centuries later by a young leader ([[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Theos\|Theos]] / [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Theia\|Theia]]) who eventually united the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|high elves]] of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] and became its first [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Tzar\|Tzar]]. The site where the scrolls are said to have been discovered is now known as [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Terra Sigillata/Terra Sigillata\|Terra Sigillata]], and is generally regarded as the most holy place in all of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]].
