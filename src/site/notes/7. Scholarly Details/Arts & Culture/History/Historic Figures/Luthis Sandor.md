# Luthis Sandor

A [[5. Factions/The Nishanti/The Nishanti\|The Nishanti]] leader who initiated a rebellion against (and ultimately assassinated) [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Wulfram von Durchenwald\|Wulfram von Durchenwald]]. This rebellion is seen as the official beginning of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], and the origin of the [[Republican\|Republican]] faction. History has said that Luthis lost the war that he started, though he has always claimed that he does not see it that way.
