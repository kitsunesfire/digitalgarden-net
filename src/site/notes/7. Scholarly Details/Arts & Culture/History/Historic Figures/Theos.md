# Theos / Theia  

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Theos\| Theos / Theia]] was the first [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Tzar\|Tzar]] of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]; their two given names have been used interchangeably in various historical accounts of their life and legacy. They were considered to be a [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elf]] of considerable beauty, though their exact depiction tends to shift depending on the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Province]]. The most popular myths depict them with two children-- one [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Moon Elf\|Moon Elf]] and one [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Sun Elf\|Sun Elf]]-- but sometimes they have as many as five children and in other stories they have none. Their symbol is an open eye, as they were believed to have been born with incredible powers of sight and insight and, over the course of their life, developed the ability to predict the future. Some of the more superstitious Zarthurians believe that [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Theos\|Theos / Theia]] blessed this continent (and perhaps even the whole of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]), and that this blessing is what provides radiance to gold, silver, precious metals, and gemstones.
