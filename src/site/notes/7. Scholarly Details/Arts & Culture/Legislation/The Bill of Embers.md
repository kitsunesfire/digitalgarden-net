# The Bill of Embers

Removes the standard Imperial restrictions on spellcasting if a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/State of Emergency\|State of Emergency]] has been declared, effectively pardoning a mage from otherwise [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Illegal Magic\|criminal acts]] (such as catching civilians in magical crossfire, performing mind control on members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]], or performing non state-sanctioned resurrections, for example).
