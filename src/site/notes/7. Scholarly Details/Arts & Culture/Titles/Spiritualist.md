# Spiritualist

The proper title for someone who is capable of summoning [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeons]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] are said to have toppled empires and challenged gods. In ancient times, they were both venerated as saviors and feared as destroyers. Marked with [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|sigils]] of starlight, these gifted few can call forth the likes of demons, dragons, angels, and elementals—but only the strongest among them can actually control the forces they unleash.

While many who dabble in the arcane can become adept at beckoning entities from the farthest reaches of the planes, none are more skilled at it than the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualist]]. This practitioner of ancient magic forms a close bond with one particular entity, known as an [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]], who gains power as the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualist]] becomes more proficient at their summoning and their bond becomes stronger. While a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualist’s]] power comes from within and is truly their own, in the most dire and dangerous of circumstances they must be able to rely on their [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] companions to help them pull through-- for while a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualist]] and their [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] may function as individuals, their true power lies in what they are able to accomplish together. It is said that the two are forever linked, each sharing a shard of their own [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]] in a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] that cannot be broken. 

All [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] are marked by a [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|Starlight Sigil]], which first appears whenever they form their [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]]. These distinct markings have lead to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] being called "star-touched", and have at different times in history been worn with great pride and tremendous shame. They can appear anywhere on their body, and are typically no larger than the size of a palm of the hand, though exceptions have been known to occur. A matched marking also appears on the [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon's]] form, though sometimes there are slight variances in angle, scale, or pigmentation. A [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualist’s]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|Starlight Sigil]] glows whenever they utilize their powers-- most commonly, whenever they are summoning their [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] or issuing them commands in battle. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] themselves are viewed as some of the most powerful and deadly creatures to have ever existed in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. By extension, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] who are able to call upon them have traditionally been revered as nobility in recognition of this strength-- but during the reign of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/Historic Figures/Radegonde von Aegir\|Radegonde von Aegir]], attitudes shifted towards fear as [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] were conscripted and forced to serve as weapons of war. After all, even in times of peace, [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] had always been known to be very versatile and capable combatants; since they have the potential to make a [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] with such a wide variety of entities, their resulting abilities are extremely unpredictable and enable them fill a wide variety of roles on (and off) the battlefield. In the years that followed the bloody and merciless [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of the Heavens\|War of the Heavens]], a series of witch hunts were carried out to eradicate [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]] and all who supported them.
