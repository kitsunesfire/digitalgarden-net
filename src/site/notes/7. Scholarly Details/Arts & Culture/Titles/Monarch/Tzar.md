# Tzar

An ancient term for "leader" that was used in Zarthura in times long gone. The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Tzar\|Tzar]] was the center of Zarthurian society, the guarantor of order for the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Madjai\|Madjai]] and the rest of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]], and the recipient of divine guidance and blessings. They were ultimately responsible for all of their subjects-- both the living and the dead, for it was seen as the [[7.
