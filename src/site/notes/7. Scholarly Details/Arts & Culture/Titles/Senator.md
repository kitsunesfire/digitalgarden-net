# Senator

Title held by the administrative and judicial leader of a [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. Currently, there are seven [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. 

As a member of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]], every [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] has an array of responsibilities they must uphold in addition to their usual duties, including acting as council to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]], enforcing Eternian law and confirming new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] appointments. 

Most importantly, [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] are also the ones who effectively select and confirm the new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]. Under normal circumstances, in the final year of a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s rule, an election will be held in which the members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Magistrate Assembly\|Magistrate Assembly]] vote for their new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]. The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] are theoretically allowed to vote for whomever they choose-- however, since the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] are the ones who appoint [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] within their [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Province]], it is extremely unusual for a province's [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] not to either vote in favor of their own [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] or for one of their [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]]'s allies.  Once the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Magistrate Assembly\|Magistrate Assembly]]'s votes have been collected by the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ministry of Justice\|Ministry of Justice]], they are carefully tallied and the individual with the highest number of votes is announced as the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]]. As the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] with the highest numbers of appointed [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] (and historically the strongest alliances with other neighboring [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]]), most [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidates]] tend to be the former [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]], the [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Lunar Highlands\|Lunar Highlands]], or the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]].  

After a new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]] has been chosen, they are presented to the public and given a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]], or a "coronation period". The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] is not one single event, but rather a long-lasting process that includes several festivals, rites, ceremonies that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]]  has to celebrate first, before he or she is allowed to wear the crown. It is customary for [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] to last for one year, but records show that in the past there have been [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] that were either significantly longer or shorter for certain rulers; no formal justification has ever been recorded for this variance. The time spent in [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] is not traditionally counted in a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Rules of Succession/Regnal Year Count\|Regnal Year Count]], for they are not considered to have "truly" begun their rule until after the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] has been completed. 

During [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]], it is customary for each of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] to issue a trial to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]]-- either to prove or to challenge their worthiness. While the trials are intended to be designed to evaluate the candidate's suitability as a leader, there are no formal regulations on what the trial should or should not be. Therefore, if the candidate is highly favored by the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]], they are free to decree an extraordinarily simple task-- or the inverse, should the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] wish to see the candidate fail. Even so, the trials are also meant to serve as an opportunity for the candidate to show off and earn public favor, so setting too easy of a task can backfire as it may imply that the candidate is incapable of greater accomplishment or needs assistance, or that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] is undemanding and easy to impress. Likewise, it is a risk for a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] to appoint a highly challenging task that they intend for the candidate to fail, because if the candidate manages to overcome the odds they are far more likely to gain public support and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] will then have a great deal of pressure on them to support the candidate regardless of their personal feelings-- not to mention these kinds of rigged trials are often seen for what they are and strongly disliked by the public, which may result in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] either resigning or being forcibly replaced. 

Once the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] has been completed and the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] has given their final approval, the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]] is confirmed by and for their public in an elaborate ceremony that marks the official start of their rule. In [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], this final step of confirmation is called "ascension". 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] tend to wear white and gold, and are each given a gold signet ring and a circlet to denote their status.
