[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|Crystal Shards]] are mined from [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Aether Crystal\|aether crystals]]. Most of the time, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|Crystal Shards]] are not pure enough to be useful on their own, so they are brought to refineries where they are sorted based on their primary [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aspects\|aspect]], then ground into a fine dust. This dust is one of the main ingredients that go into crafting new [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]]. 

Rarely, a [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|Crystal Shard]] will be large enough and of high enough quality that it can instead be used in its natural form. These shards typically end up being used in the crafting of certain specialty items such as [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Artifacts/Spirit Locket\|spirit lockets]] or high-end staves, but sometimes they are set aside for use in [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] experiments. Only the largest and purest shards are suitable for being formed into [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]]-- one of the rarest and most valuable substances in all of creation.
