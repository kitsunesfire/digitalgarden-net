[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are small orbs of concentrated magical energy. There are ten types of standard [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] ([[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Radiant\|Radiant]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]]), as well as the far more rare (and more powerful) untyped version, known as [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]]. All [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are formed from [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|aether crystal shards]], and are most commonly used for aiding in various municipal tasks within the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], such as providing water, heat, ice for food preservation, and light for street lamps. They shatter after a certain amount of use, making the need for new [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] constant. 

Though [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are theoretically distributed evenly and fairly across the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], in practice, the wealthier and more powerful [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] get their hands on more or better quality [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]], whereas the poor have to make do with what they can get. Smuggling rings and [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Corsairs/Corsairs\|Corsairs]] often attempt to divert [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] shipments, and there is a lot of money to be made in the sale of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] on the black market.
