Crafted as a product of the newfound partnership between researchers within the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] and the artisans of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]] are made out of specially purified and engraved [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|aether crystal shards]]. Once harvested, rather than being crushed into dust and formed into [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]], these raw [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|crystal shards]] are instead carefully cut, shaped, polished, purified, and then finally etched with delicate runes that can unlock this material's true potency and potential. Unlike normal [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]] is "unaspected", meaning it has the theoretical potential to absorb, store, and expend any type of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]]. This quality makes it extremely useful for a number of applications-- especially summoning, which is not normally possible with standard [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]].
