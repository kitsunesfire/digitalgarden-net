# Ambrosia

While mortals need food and drink to survive, immortals such as [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|seraphs]] typically have no such requirement. Though they may occasionally choose to partake all the same, for the sake of tradition, revelry, or politeness when offered, more often than not they find the act of consumption to be a waste of time and will generally refuse refreshment. However, there exists one exception-- for even the gods themselves find it difficult to resist the temptation of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Ambrosia\|Ambrosia]]. 

Named for [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ambrose\|Ambrose]], one of the ancient deities of seduction, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Ambrosia\|Ambrosia]] is an amber liquor whose flavor simply cannot be described. Some say its qualities adapt to the imbiber, tasting of whatever is the richest, most delicious substance that their imagination can conjure. Others say it only gains its potency once it has been transferred to another through a selfless act of giving. Thus, it is particularly popular as an offering to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|gods]], or as a wedding or housewarming gift for the exceptionally wealthy and well-connected. 

At present, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Ambrosia\|Ambrosia]] is only known to be able to be produced in one of two places: the distant, rolling hills of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]], and an ancient monastery in the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Immermehr/Immermehr\|Immermehr]] region of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]].
