# Flayleaf

Flayleaf has narrow, reddish-brown leaves droop from these wiry shrubs. Harvesting the narcotic leaves of flayleaf plants is fraught with peril, as colonies of poisonous, red-bellied spiders often build their nests in the plants. Flayleaf can be found in nearly any temperate environment. When harvested before the leaves turn brittle and dark brown, flayleaf leaves can be smoked as pipe weed or rolled into thin paper and burned until they smolder.
