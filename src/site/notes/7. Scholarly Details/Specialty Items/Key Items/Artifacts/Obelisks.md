The [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] are minor [[Artifacts\|Artifacts]] in the form of a menhir, inscribed with [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Runes/Astral Runes\|Astral Runes]] designed to regulate and stabilize the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Polarities\|polarities]] of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]] within its area of effect. In this way, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] are able to cleanse an area of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|miasma]] poisoning and other similar afflictions.

The [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] are powered by [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]], which must be renewed with a special ritual each year in order to keep functioning. Should one of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] go more than a year without a maintenance ritual, it can be damaged as any other object, though it remains a dense and difficult to break stone. Destroying one of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] breaks its link in the chain of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]], though the gap in its effect can vary between a few dozen feet to several miles in length. 

[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] are hailed as a miraculous breakthrough in [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]], as they provide similar benefits to the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Cleansing\|Cleansing]] rituals but are able to cover a much wider area and only need to be renewed once a year. However, they do have their limitations-- they are only able to be constructed on [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]], and they require valuable resources to function, which sometimes makes them targets for vandalism and theft. 

In recent years, a network of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisks\|Obelisks]] has been established along the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] due to a collaboration between the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]] and the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]]. The majority of this network runs along the central and eastern [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Empire]], as the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have resisted efforts to expand the network through most of the [[4. Gazetteer/Gaean Heartlands/Gaean Heartlands\|Gaean Heartlands]].
