# Artifacts

A globe of utter darkness that consumes all things. Powerful weapons created in antiquity carrying the hopes of an entire people. A simple deck of cards representing fortunes both transcendent and deadly. These are artifacts—items of incredible power, spoken of in thousands of stories and beyond the capability of modern people to create.  
  
Stranger and more powerful than other magic items, artifacts can change the course of history in the right hands—or the wrong hands. Simply finding an artifact is a pivotal moment in the campaign, its presence rippling throughout your entire game and warping the story around it. Some entire adventures may revolve around one artifact!  
  
Artifacts will not be found in normal treasure hoards, even at 20th level. These are set-piece treasures, that only come about in exceptional circumstances.
