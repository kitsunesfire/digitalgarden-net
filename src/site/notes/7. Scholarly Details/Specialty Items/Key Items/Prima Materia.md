Crafted as a product of the newfound partnership between researchers within the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] and the artisans of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]] are made out of specially purified and engraved [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Crystal Shards\|Crystal Shards]]. Once harvested, rather than being crushed into dust and formed into [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Materia\|Materia]], the raw [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Crystal Shards\|Crystal Shards]] are instead carefully cut, shaped, polished, purified, and then finally etched with delicate runes that can unlock this material's true potency and potential.
