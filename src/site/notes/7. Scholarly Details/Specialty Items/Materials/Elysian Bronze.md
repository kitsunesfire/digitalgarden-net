Elysian bronze is a beautiful metal with a burnished surface, ranging in metallic tones depending on the angle of light. Perhaps the rarest of all metals, this mysterious element only forms in the far reaches of the outer planes, and is said to have been brought to Sharum Mal'Kari as a gift from the gods.
