[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Crystal Shards\|Crystal Shards]] are mined from [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Core Crystals\|Core Crystals]]. Most of the time, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Crystal Shards\|Crystal Shards]] are not pure enough to be useful on their own, so they are brought to refineries where they are sorted based on their [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Aspects\|aspect]], then ground into a fine dust. This dust is one of the primary ingredients that go into crafting new [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Materia\|Materia]]. 

Rarely, a [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Crystal Shards\|Crystal Shard]] will be large enough and high enough quality that it can instead be used in its natural form. These shards typically end up being used in the crafting of certain [[Specialty Items\|Specialty Items]] such as [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Spirit Locket\|Spirit Locket]] or high-end staves, but sometimes they are set aside for use in [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] experiments. Only the largest shards are suitable for being formed into [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]]-- one of the rarest and most valuable substances in all of creation.
