# Druchite

Druchite is a black-and-violet ore native to [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]] that is so dark that even creatures that are adapted to see in lightless conditions can have extreme difficulty perceiving it. Druchite ore can be worked into armor and weapons by applying it in delicate veins or inlaid patterns across the equipment. Druchite-veined armor grants the wearer additional defenses against creatures with darkvision.
