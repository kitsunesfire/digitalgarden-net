# Greenweave

Greenweave’s rarity is not due to its constituent parts. [[7.

Its surface is fuzzy and dappled with all the colors of the forest, creating a hazy optical effect when rustled by the wind. When woven into Greenweave, the resulting fabric maintains this strange appearance. Greenweave blends in with the surrounding greenery. A tent of Greenweave is far less likely to attract unwanted attention than a regular tent.
