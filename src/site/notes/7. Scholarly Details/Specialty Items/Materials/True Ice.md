[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/True Ice\|True Ice]] is a crystal that naturally occurs in cold caverns. It looks like navy-tinted ice, but unlike natural ice, does not melt and perpetually stays cold. Small [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/True Ice\|True Ice]] crystals are sometimes used to keep perishables fresh while in transit, or by traveling medics to treat minor bruises and burns. Large crystals are rare, but may be fashioned into blades or worked into armor plating.
