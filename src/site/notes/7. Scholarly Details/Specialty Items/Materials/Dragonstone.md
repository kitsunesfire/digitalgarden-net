[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] is the name given to opalescent geodes that tend to form in places that have had long-term exposure to draconic magic. Similar to [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Core Crystals\|Core Crystals]] (but much, much smaller), these stones are potent magical catalysts with a core of pure magical energy at its center. When cracked open, this core is released, often to unpredictable effect-- making working with [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] a very dangerous but occasionally fruitful endeavor. [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] is much harder to work with than [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Core Crystals\|Core Crystals]], and frequently flakes apart into thin scale-like fragments; it is very rare to find a solid piece of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] larger than the size of an apricot. As a result, most [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] ends up being either refined and worked into pieces of stronger material or ground into dust.
