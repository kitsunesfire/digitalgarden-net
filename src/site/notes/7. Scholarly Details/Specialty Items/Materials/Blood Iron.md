# Blood Iron

[[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Blood Iron\|Blood Iron]] is a rust-red metal that is a special form of steel (despite the name) that is infused with blood in the forging processâ€” usually that of ritualistically sacrificed and oftentimes sacred animal such as a rooster or bull (though in certain circles or desperate situations, a human sacrifice might be used).
