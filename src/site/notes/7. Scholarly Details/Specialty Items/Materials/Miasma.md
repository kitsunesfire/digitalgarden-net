Also known as "dark [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Ichor\|Ichor]]", [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] is a manifestation of void-aligned magical energy that is light-absorbing and corrosive. It is not typically visible to the common eye except in high concentrations. It usually manifests as a mist, but in high concentrations it may become a dark, mercury-like substance. 

Sometimes, in areas where [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] is present, creatures seem to appear from "thin air", dropping down from the sky or rising from a pool of black smoke on the floor, likely manifesting from the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] latent within the air and ground itself. Many of these defeated aberrations will disperse into smoke or melt into the ground, leaving behind little evidence of their existence. 

While associated with Aberrations, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] is not exclusively the magic of mindless monsters. It has also been recorded that [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]], [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Extraplanar/Devil\|devils]], and other void-aligned beings have an affinity for [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]], and may even be able to use it regularly with little (or no) harmful side effects. Many hundreds of years ago, it was understood as the magic of great archmagi, though evidence of their mastery of the art disappeared with them long ago. It is believed to have the capacity to mutate normal wildlife into fiends-- but the nature of this process, or why it occurs, is poorly understood. 

Archeologists have discovered references in ruins and ancient texts to a lost civilization whose people have once devised a wide variety of methods by which they could harness the power of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]]... but in every case, these accounts are infuriatingly incomplete, leaving significant portions up to the readerâ€™s own interpretation and imagination. When it has been successfully stabilized, [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] could theoretically be used for a variety of applications, such as a highly efficient fuel source, a potent magical catalyst, or even as a component to be forged into a highly resilient metal.
