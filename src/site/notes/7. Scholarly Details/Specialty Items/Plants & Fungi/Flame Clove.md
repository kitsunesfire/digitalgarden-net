# Flame Clove

Flame Clove is a garlic-like herb that is a favorite with travelers. Raw flame clove contains a mild but unpleasant poison. When boiled in salt water and crushed, however, flame clove has a taste similar to garlic and keeps hot food warm for 1d4 days without drying out and without requiring a heat source.
