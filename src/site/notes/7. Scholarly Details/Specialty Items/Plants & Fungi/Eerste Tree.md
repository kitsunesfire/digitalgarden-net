# Eerste Tree

Eerste trees tower above most other trees, and are widely held as the “first trees”. Lumberjacks superstitiously connect them to woodland spirits and, despite the strength of the wood, often avoid harvesting them. Nature enthusiasts revere them. These silver-barked hardwoods grow to immense heights, but never spread to more than a few feet in diameter.
