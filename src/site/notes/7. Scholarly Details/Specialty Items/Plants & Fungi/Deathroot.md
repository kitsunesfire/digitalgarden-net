# Deathroot

Deathroot has been used in magic and potion making for centuries. It’s a fragile-looking plant with a thin stalk and purple flowers, which fruits once a year developing bright red fleshy pods that cause disorientation and dizziness if ingested. There are two varieties. The more common Arcanist Deathroot was first found by Archon Helene when she discovered it growing on several dead slaves. The other, Lunatic’s Deathroot, is most closely associated with the story of the courtesan Melusine, who sought revenge on a powerful mage and his family. She harvested the plant, baked it into small pies for the mage’s banquet, and presented them to the mage. All the guests were seized by terrifying hallucinations after eating the pies and tore each other to pieces.
