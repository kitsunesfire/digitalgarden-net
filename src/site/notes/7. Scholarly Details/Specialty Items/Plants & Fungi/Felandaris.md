# Felandaris

Felandaris means “demon weed”, which is fitting for this rare plant because it only grows in places where the Veil is thin. It is easily identified; it is a twisted, wicked-looking shrub with long, thorny shoots and no leaves. Many swear the plant radiates a palpable aura of malevolence, so it comes as no surprise that it unnerves many a junior herbalist.
