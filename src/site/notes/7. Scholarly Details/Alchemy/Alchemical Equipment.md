## Alchemy Kits

The core of any alchemy kit is the retort-- a round, pear-shaped lidded pot with a spout pointed downwards from the side, usually made from specially processed glass or clay. The top third can be detached for insertion and extraction, and can allow for use of the bottom as a simple pot.

Objects placed within the retort are heated by placing a source of heat at the bottom. A small flash is then placed underneath the spout, and as gas forms and cools down, liquid will drip out of it and into the flask. Depending on the particular recipe, the remaining material in the retort may either be collected or discarded. 

A mortar and pestle is kept on hand to prepare solids for the retort or flask, and a thin rod with a flared end is usually used to stir the concoction within the flask. 

A small knife is used on occasion to cut up larger materials, or to separate things such as bone or stems from ingredients. Finally, a small lidded cylinder is used to shake and mix dusts and other groups of solid ingredients. Pouches for ingredients, flasks for potions, and ceramic bomb casings are also common additions, with the entire kit being carried inside a sizable pouched bag.
