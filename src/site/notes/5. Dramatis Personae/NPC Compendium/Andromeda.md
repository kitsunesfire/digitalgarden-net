# Notes

The current [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Exarch\|Exarch]] of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] Church.

Much of Andromeda's public persona is a front. She is driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and power, and more than anything else she seeks enlightenment-- not for the betterment of the world, but for her own personal gain and ascendency, which she believes has been prophesied. She is convinced that the world is in a state of imbalance, and that only through her acquisition of absolute knowledge and power can she restore equilibrium. She believes that [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Eldest/Abraxas\|Abraxas]] is simply one more in a long line of teachers to be bested, and seriously misjudges the nature of their relationship.
