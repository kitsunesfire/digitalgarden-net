- Spoke to the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Core Party\|Core Party]] during the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] ritual at [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]], seemingly breaking them from their hypnosis 
- Has remained a mystery, but insists they mean to help
