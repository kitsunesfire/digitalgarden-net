# Oleander

Oleander is remembered as one of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]]. Also known as the Alchemist of Souls and the Breaker of Shadows, it is Oleander's research into [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] that resulted in the breakthrough that both slowed its spread and made it a (partly) treatable condition. There are countless lives who have been made possible due to his efforts. His work has been hugely inspirational to the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]], who have referenced his methodology in developing their own healing techniques and rituals.
