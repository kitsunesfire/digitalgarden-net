# Heroes of Prophecy

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]] ([[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Anka\|Anka]], [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Fredja\|Fredja]], [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Oleander\|Oleander]], [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Raymundo\|Raymundo]], and [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Tayla\|Tayla]]) are the five heroes who saved [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] when they confronted the Wild Hunt and stopped Ragnarok. Through their combined efforts, the spread of [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] was slowed (and even became somewhat treatable), [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]] was healed, and the flow of primal magic to and from each of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Primordial Sources\|Primordial Sources]] was restored.
