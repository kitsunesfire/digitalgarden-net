# Luthis Sandor

A [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] leader who initiated a rebellion against (and ultimately assassinated) [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Wulfram von Durchenwald\|Wulfram von Durchenwald]]. This rebellion is seen as the official beginning of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], and the origin of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Republican\|Republican]] faction. History has said that Luthis lost the war that he started, though he has always claimed that he does not see it that way.
