# Ulricht Von Hein

A deeply pious [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]'s history, he formally established and protected the system of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Chosen\|Chosen]] in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] and allocated so much funding to Zarthurian temples that some are still operating off of his gifts to this day. A record number of shrines were constructed under his rule, in part due to financial incentives granted to any building that housed one. A number of historic temples, churches, and holy sites were also proclaimed to be national landmarks under his reign, including the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Janova/Church of Revelation\|Church of Revelation]] in [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Janova/Janova\|Janova]].
