Also known as the "Red Kaiser", [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/Historic Figures/Wulfram von Durchenwald\|Wulfram von Durchenwald]] is famous in Zarthurian history as the last [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] to reign over the land. His rule was relatively brief, but in his time he accomplished much, personally overseeing many breakthroughs in [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Magitek/Magitek\|Magitek]] and [[2. Rules Reference/Skills/Medicine\|Medicine]] that enabled his people to survive the worst of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] through the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]] relatively unscathed. However, his moniker was earned through his ruthless demeanor and the cruelty he displayed towards his enemies, for he was also well-known for his horrific and torturous experiments that he conducted upon [[3.

The Red [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]]'s reign was brought to an untimely end when one of his own men, a fellow [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] by the name of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Historic Figures/Luthis Sandor\|Luthis Sandor]], betrayed him and assassinated him. This assassination lead to a devastating civil war called [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], which ultimately caused the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]] and nearly drove the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] into extinction.
