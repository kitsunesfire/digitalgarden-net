# Suria

Haughty and arrogant, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]] generally feel themselves superior to all others-- even the other [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Noble Houses\|Noble Houses]]. They are slow to smile, quick to disparage, and always ready to demonstrate their peerless knowledge and skill. Most [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]] could be described as conservative, deliberate, and proud, with a reputation for being considerably more powerful but far less durable than other Zarthurians.

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]] value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above all else. Their long history of brutally exacting revenge for their fallen [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Legionary\|legionnaires ]]and family members have painted them as "radiant [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]]" in the eyes of their neighbors-- especially the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]], who view them as overly sentimental. In contrast to this reputation, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]] boast a spiritual, artistic and compassionate culture that is rarely seen outside of their gilded citadels. 

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]] value order in a way that is uncommon amongst [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|elves]], preferring to master a skill before applying it rather than learning as they go. Rushing is out of nature to [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]], who, while less versatile than most [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Elf\|elvenkind]], often have a mastery of whatever it is they apply themselves to. As a general rule, they are especially likely to study [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|reiki]], and more often than not possess a natural talent for the divine. 

Though there are exceptions, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Surians]] are generally far less motivated to become adventurers than most, and tend to prefer to keep to themselves within the confines of their elaborately constructed settlements. After all, their ancient, highly fortified cities are the stuff legends like El Dorado are made of, with their tremendous history, beauty and cultural significance spoken of across the realms-- they have little incentive to leave such lavish homes, especially when what surrounds them is the inhospitable hellscape of the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]].
