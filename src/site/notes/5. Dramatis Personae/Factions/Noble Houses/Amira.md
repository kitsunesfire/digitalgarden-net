# Amira

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]] are a noble house of (mostly) [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Moon Elf\|moon elves]] that live in the northern regions of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. They are considered by many to be\dangerous, mysterious, and heartless, and are famous for their agility. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]] tend not to like outsiders-- especially [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Suria\|Suria]], who they typically view as heretical and overly sentimental. 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]] are known for their speed, and tend to be very difficult to capture. When they fight, they traditionally wield highly agile weaponry and prefer to use ambush tactics; those who fight them and live to tell the tale compare it to fighting living darkness. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]] are also associated with mind-altering magic and controlling spells, though they would claim that they only use these nightmarish techniques as a last resort when cornered or outnumbered. Only their professional fighters are trusted with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amiran]] signature weapons: the butterfly swords, a paired set of mithril blades infamous both for their lethal precision and their elegance. 

They are well known for their control over shadows, and often possess strange occult powers. Some [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Amira\|Amira]] are even said to be able to pass freely between [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]], seemingly emerging from shaded corners and vanishing without a trace. Through their mastery of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] magic and strange occult rituals, they alone are able to thrive where few others would dare to even step, granting them access to the parts of Zarthura's underbelly where the light of day can never be seen.
