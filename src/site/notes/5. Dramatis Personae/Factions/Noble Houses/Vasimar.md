The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are counted as one of the ancient [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Noble Houses\|Noble Houses]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], though they have had a reputation for generally staying out-- or being kept out-- of Imperial politics. They are best known for their adherence to the "old ways": specifically, the ancient primal traditions of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]]. 

Many of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are local idol priests, who see divinity not only in the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] but in all things, and see a divine force at work in the universe as a whole. As a people they are taught to believe that the world itself has a sentience and sapience of its own, which they refer to as [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Mona'din\|Mona'din]]. They deeply revere all aspects of life, death, and rebirth as a means of honoring this Goddess Who Slumbers Within. In their work and in their worship they present themselves as "humble gardeners" who meticulously and fervently tend to the Blessed Domain of their Goddess. They believe they have been charged with maintaining her Glorious and Most Generous creations-- and been blessed with the means to do so.  

Each of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] channel the power of the universe in a different way, usually through worship of a particular idol, holy site, or local [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|deity]]. They do not generally believe that their Goddess has any particular "agenda", so they most often strive for balance and moderation, both for themselves and the world around them. This attitude often led them to take the role of mediators in olden times, but nowadays it is far less common for the populace to seek the counsel of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]], often preferring the more immediate and dramatic results that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] can provide.

Ever since it was founded, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have vehemently and vocally opposed the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Church of the Celestine]]. It is their belief that the ancient rituals that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] have revived should have stayed forgotten, and that their practices actively bring harm to [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Mona'din\|Mona'din]]. However, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are seen as old-fashioned, out of touch, and increasingly irrelevant, which means that their complaints typically fall on deaf ears.
