# The Pantheist League

Zarthurians within the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Pantheist League\|Pantheist League]] followed a different version of traditional [[7. Common Knowledge/Daily Life/Faith\|Faith]]. Pantheists recognized only 12 "True Gods", and the worship of all other [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] was forbidden. Pantheists believed that the 12 True Gods were the only ones who deserved to be worshipped since the priests of those gods were said to be the first to swear allegiance to the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]]. 

Devotees of this particular pantheon had a difficult time converting average Zarthurians, who were often quite attached to their local [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] and feared offending them. After some time they ended up taking to the seas to spread their worship more widely, even venturing across the mainland of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], where their gods would eventually became known as [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]].
