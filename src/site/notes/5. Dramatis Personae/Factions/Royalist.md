# Royalist

In [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalist\|Royalist]] is someone who is loyal to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Zarthurian Monarchy]]-- but do not support the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalist\|Royalists]] believe that it was a mistake to become an Empire, and desire to return to a time of monarchic rule. They are typically traditionalist, isolationist, and distrust most foreigners. Most [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] and many [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/High Elf\|high elves]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]] would be considered to be [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalist\|Royalist]]. 

While [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalist\|Royalists]] support greater independence for each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]], they believe that the only way [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] can remain united is to unite under the rule of the monarchy. They agree with some of the frustrations of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Republican\|Republicans]], but see them as far too radical and reject their desire to remove the crown from Zarthurian governance.
