- [Q] *Mysterium Apocalypsis* - Mystery is Revelation.

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]] is a group of scholars dedicated to preserving all knowledge-- even reprehensible works by [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]] worshippers, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Goetia\|Goetic]] mages and necromancers-- against a future dark age. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archivists]] specialize in translating archaic texts and helping those who have had their minds stolen by magic, and spend much of their time protecting and copying ancient writings. 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]] believes that some ancient civilization lived in Zarthura long ago -- perhaps even before the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|high elves]] -- and that their ancient magics still remain hidden within the ruins and lost cities of the Land of Fate, just waiting to be found. They also believe that members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Eternian Government\|Eternian Government]] (specifically, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Cabinet/Ministry of Secrets\|Ministry of Secrets]]) are more aware of this history and its related relics than they let on, and claim to have evidence that the government is secretly destroying relics and intentionally causing ruins to collapse to hide some larger inconvenient truth. Of course, Eternian politicians frequently dismiss these claims as either outrageous conspiracy theories, the mad ravings of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]] worshippers, or incendiary foreign propaganda, forcing the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]] to work secretly and mostly underground. 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]] is a fairly loose organization, with a large number of members being independent wizards and historians. They tend to run fairly smoothly and efficiently, but rely on the use of either magic or blackmail to keep themselves out of trouble with the authorities when the need arises. Members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]] are fiercely loyal to one another, and always come to the defense of one another whenever they are in trouble.

No-one is entirely sure who is in charge of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]]; rumors most often depict their leader as some kind of eldritch monstrosity who has surrendered their humanity many centuries ago. Whoever-- or *whatever* -- they may be, it is believed that every so often they draw together their most trusted [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archivists]] to some sort of secret demi-plane. While they are there, these [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archivists]] are said to renew some kind of ancient vow with their leader (and one another), and then are issued their new assignments. This also means that, sometimes, when someone particularly knowledgeable or wise goes inexplicably missing for a short time, rumors may start to spread that they were being summoned by the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]].  

## Initiation into the Archive 

Anyone who wishes to apply to join the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Archive\|Archive]] is welcome to attempt their initiation. They very rarely approach people directly for admission; instead, its much more common for them to quietly spread rumors about their presence in a particular area and simply wait to see who shows up. The specific details of this initiation process have been kept secret, though it is known that it has something to do with correctly identifying magic items and contributing items or information of value to the organization.
