# Goetia

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Goetia\|Goetia]] are powerful [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]] who represent the leadership of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. In [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] very little is known about their actual identities, so they are only referenced by their titles:

- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The Lord of the Inferno\|The Lord of the Inferno]]
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The Morning Star\|The Morning Star]]
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The One Without a Master\|The One Without a Master]]
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The Serpent of the Abyss\|The Serpent of the Abyss]]

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Goetia\|Goetia]] are too powerful to be able to cross over into [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] in any of the usual ways. However, each of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Goetia\|Goetia]] are believed to have a number of subordinate [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]] under their control who can act on their behalf and may carry out their will in other realms outside of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]].
