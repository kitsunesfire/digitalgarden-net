# Order of the Scarab Sages

[[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Idris\|Idris]]’s best known [[Templars\|Templars]] are the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Templar Orders/Order of the Scarab Sages\|Order of the Scarab Sages]]. The Scarab Sages are not content with merely defeating their enemy— they seek to study and understand what it is they fight, so that they may do so more efficiently in the future. These [[Templars\|Templars]] often escort researchers into ruins, take on jobs to track rare and complicated creatures, and hire others to help them collect specimens and confirm hypotheses. They are perhaps less directly loyal to [[6. Demographics/7. NPC Compendium/Titles/The Divine\|6. Demographics/7. NPC Compendium/Titles/The Divine]] (and, by extension, [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Shiloh\|Shiloh]]) than most [[Templars\|Templars]], which has not gone unnoticed by the other orders...but so long as they continue to share their valuable insights with the rest of [[The Divine Order\|The Divine Order]], there haven’t been any problems.
