# Order of the Sacred Spirit

The best known [[Templars\|Templar]] Order associated with [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Yamin\|Yamin]] is the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Templar Orders/Order of the Sacred Spirit\|Order of the Sacred Spirit]]. This Order is seen as a radical group who believe that there may be ways of manipulating and preserving souls so that they may achieve immortality. Most other [[Templars\|Templars]] dismiss their activities as either overly ambitious or outright insane, but followers of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ziyad\|Ziyad]] often condemn them outright and refuse to recognize their authority.
