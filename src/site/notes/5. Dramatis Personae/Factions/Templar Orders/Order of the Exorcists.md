# Order of the Exorcists

[[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ba'raka\|Ba'raka]]'s best known [[Templars\|Templars]] are the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Templar Orders/Order of the Exorcists\|Order of the Exorcists]], elite holy warriors who are tasked with handling the most challenging threats to humanity. Exorcists are respected and feared by most of the population, for their presence tends to mean that the surrounding area is otherwise doomed. They complete their training in reclusive, secret schools and usually lead lives of celibate solitude, socializing only with each other. It is said that the reason Exorcists quarantine themselves in this way is to protect the public from the effects of the forbidden rituals that grant them their supernatural strength... but others believe that it is because the work required of an Exorcist eventually drives them into an animalistic madness, making them no longer suitable for civilized life.
