# Asperdrak (Black Banners)

Also commonly referred to as the Black Banners, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Asperdrak\|Asperdrak]] are a faction loyal to the former Zarthurian draconic [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarchy]]. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Asperdrak\|Banners]] believe that it was a mistake to become an Empire, and desire to return to a time of monarchic, draconic rule. They are typically traditionalist, isolationist, and distrustful of foreigners. While they are definitely a minority across [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], a growing number of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|high elves]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]] are have become [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Asperdrak\|Asperdrak]]. 

Even though the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Asperdrak\|Asperdrak]] support greater independence for each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]], they believe that the only way [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] can remain united is under the central rule of a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarch]]. They agree with some of the frustrations of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Republican\|Republicans]], but see them as far too radical and reject their desire to remove the crown from Zarthurian governance.
