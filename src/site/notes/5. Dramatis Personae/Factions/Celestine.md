- [Q] We're all divine... some of us just don't know it yet.

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]]'s work is said to have started in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], in a small private clinic as a result of [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|alchemical]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magical]] experimentation. As their innovative techniques became more refined and drew more attention, a church formed around their practitioners, which eventually came to be known as the Church of the Celestine (or The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] for short).  

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] are best known for helping people who have not yet attained their “most purified self”. They claim to be able to alter an individual's fundamental [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]], thereby changing the core of who and what they are in order to become something else—something more “perfect” and “pure”. To many in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] they are seen as miracle workers, though there are some who find their work blasphemous; it is not uncommon to find protestors near any given [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] church or clinic, which has caused the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] in turn to invest quite heavily in private bodyguards and personal protection.

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] describe their work as [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]], which is advertised as "the astral art of transformation, inner liberation, change, and purification of the self”. The members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] call themselves “[[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|Arcanimists]]”, though they are also commonly referred to as "spiritual alchemists" or "astral workers". '

Similar to the process of becoming an alchemist, a prospective [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|arcanimist]] must obtain an apprenticeship with a practicing [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|arcanimist]] to learn the secrets of the craft. Within the Church, there are ranks that indicate these levels of seniority and expertise. The newest [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|Arcanimists]] are called [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Devout\|Devout]]. [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Devout\|Devout]] typically do not have any special ability or skill bestowed upon them by the Church, beyond training in the requisite alchemical and magical talents to be accepted as an apprentice. A new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Devout\|Devout]] can expect to train for quite a long time before they are allowed to perform [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|arcanimist]] rituals; after a member has performed their first ritual, they are considered an [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Adept\|Adept]], no longer a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Devout\|Devout]]. [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Adept\|Adept]] are members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] who perform arcanimancy rituals, which enables them to manipulate essence and perform a number of services for the Church. The most senior members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] are the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Celestine Sage\|Sages]], who are second only to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Exarch\|Exarch]]. The [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Exarch\|Exarch]] is the leader of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Church of the Celestine]], often referred to simply as "their Excellency". In its history, the Church has only changed leadership once: when the founding [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Exarch\|Exarch]], his Excellency [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Vaughn Patreos\|Vaughn Patreos]], tragically passed away before attaining [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Apotheosis\|Apotheosis]].

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] are known to be protective of their literature and have a habit of encrypting all of their records and correspondence in a constellation-like code, no matter how mundane or benign the message. It is relatively rare for new [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Devout\|Devout]] to be accepted into the Church, and it is assumed (but not confirmed) that the Church’s leadership has the final say in who is allowed to move from [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Devout\|Devout]] to [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Adept\|Adept]].

Ever since their founding, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] have found themselves at odds with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]]. While the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] agree with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]]'s beliefs that the world itself has sentience, which they call [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gaea\|Gaea]]-- they disagree on the nature of this goddess. In the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]]'s worldview, Gaea is typically presented as a neutral-if-not-benign force who cares for and watches over her creations as her own children. However, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] challenge this notion, insisting that a truly benevolent force would never have allowed her children to suffer as they have (and still do) in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. Instead, in their teachings, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] express that the world we live upon is little more than a prison designed by a truly malevolent and cruel goddess, meant to entrap all of humanity and purposefully limit their potential. It is their belief that the reality that has been presented to us is just a trick, and that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are either fools for falling for it or agents of evil knowingly perpetuating the ruse. In either case, they feel that the only salvation from this nightmare state is to first witness and accept the enlightened truth of the universe, then to purify oneself so that they may be welcomed to join the one "true" God ([[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]]) in the cosmos.
