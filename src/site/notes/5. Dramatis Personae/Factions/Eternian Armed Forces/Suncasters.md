 [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]] dedicate themselves to the study of holy [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Radiant\|light]] so that [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Goetia\|goetic]] threats can be confined to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|darkness from whence they came]]. These highly educated mages are primarily responsible for maintaining the ritual seal over [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Mors Omnia/Mors Omnia\|Mors Omnia]] and providing support to the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Justiciars\|Solar Justiciars]], as well as providing council to important members of Zarthurian society; ever since the establishment of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]], the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]] has always been a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncaster]].
 
[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]] may specialize in a variety of disciplines, though most end up choosing some combination of healing magic, offensive magic, and control spells. Standard [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]] dress in uniforms of bronze, gold, white, and deep red. They tend to be [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|reiki]] casters, but the study of other forms of magic is welcome and encouraged-- so long as it is not [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Goetia\|Goetic]] magic, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|void]] magic, or any other manifestations of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]] worship.
