# Imperial Army

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] is made up of trained soldiers who have enlisted and pledged their loyalty to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. In exchange for this loyalty and service, imperial soldiers often hold positions of status in their assigned settlements and may be gifted [[6. Common Knowledge/Currency & Trade/Special Currency/Gil\|gil]], plots of land, or even special political favors as they rise in rank and prove their worth. 

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] regiments are typically comprised of around 7 individuals each, broken into three infantry lines. In times of active duty these numbers can grow quite dramatically, as they may also travel with other members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Eternian Armed Forces\|Eternian Armed Forces]] and/or a few specialized civilian camp followers, such as a priest, engineer, alchemist, musician, or a record-keeper. 

All members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] are granted free tuition to the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Places/Imperial Academy\|Imperial Academy]], which they are encouraged to make use of in between their assignments. For many Zarthurians, this may be their best or only opportunity to access formal education, so it often serves as a strong motivator to join the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|army's]] ranks. Additionally, imperial soldiers (and their immediate family members) have all of their medical needs tended to at the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Janova/RMC\|RMC]] free of charge-- which can be an enticing offer for those with significant medical needs.
