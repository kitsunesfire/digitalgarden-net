# Imperial Army

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] is made up of trained soldiers who have enlisted and pledged their loyalty to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. In exchange for this loyalty and service, high ranking imperial soldiers often hold positions of status in their assigned settlements and may be gifted [[6. Common Knowledge/Currency & Trade/Special Currency/Gil\|gil]], plots of land, or even special political favors as they rise in status and prove their worth. 

However, low-rank members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] are not paid particularly well for their efforts, and tend to earn far more by looting what they can from the battlefield than they do by staying inside the garrison. For this reason, members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] have a reputation of being hot-headed and eager to fight, and will often take up side jobs hunting monsters or escorting cargo caravans for some extra coin. In fact, most of the foot soldiers of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] have proven themselves to be far more loyal to coin than to country-- and as a result, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] have developed a reputation for being able to be rather easily bribed and corrupted. 

All members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] are granted free tuition to the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Places/Imperial Academy\|Imperial Academy]], which they are encouraged to make use of in between their assignments. For many Zarthurians, this may be their best or only opportunity to access formal education, so it often serves as a strong motivator to join the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|army's]] ranks. Additionally, imperial soldiers (and their immediate family members) have all of their medical needs tended to at the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Janova/RMC\|RMC]] free of charge-- which can be an enticing offer for those with significant medical needs.
