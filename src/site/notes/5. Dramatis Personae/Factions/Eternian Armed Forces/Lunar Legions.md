The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are the signature warrior units of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Amira\|Amiran]] tradition, famed for their highly disciplined training. Under the reign of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Tzar\|Tzar]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Eyvora Ackermann\|Eyvora Ackermann]], they became appointed as the first official Zarthurian Crownsguard and have served as personal bodyguards for [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarchs]] and their families ever since. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] always receive their training in [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Vernug Macht/Vernug Macht\|Vernug Macht]] but are stationed in [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]] and other important strategic locations across [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] in order to defend the interests of the crown. Wherever they are stationed, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are often feared and dreaded by most of the population they serve-- even the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]]. 

Each [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legion]] is designed to be a small, highly efficient, independent and organized military cohort, typically comprised of between two and five [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|legionaries]]. Once formed, they are expected to train together extensively, and are strongly encouraged to develop close relationships with each other to enhance unit cohesion. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Legionaries]] are usually members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] who have proven themselves with exceptional skill and loyal service, and must be able to pass a series of aptitude exams before they can be admitted to [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Vernug Macht/Vernug Macht\|Vernug Macht]].

In addition to their combat skills, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are known for their nearly limitless access to palace intrigues and high degree of political influence. There are a number of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|legionaries]] assigned to the capital garrison at all times who tend to move about in the shadows of the castle, constantly keeping watch over their charge(s). In times of conflict, it is common for [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|legionaries]] to serve as commanders in the field and to be posted near the senior officer's tent in camp.

All [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] benefit from several advantages, including permission to bear arms within the city of [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]], access to private barracks, and substantially higher pay than Eternian soldiers of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]]. This salary is also regularly augmented by subsidies of food and supplies that are typically distributed at important times for the Empire, such as a royal birth, a noble wedding, or following a failed attempted revolt. Additionally, the standard service of a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|legionary]] is shorter in duration than that of a common soldier. This early retirement is traditionally spent either in a beachside villa in [[4. Gazetteer/Auroric Shores/Hesperia/Hesperia\|Hesperia]] or an alpine chalet in [[4. Gazetteer/Evenfall Isles/Isara/Isara\|Isara]], though some may choose to remain wherever they were stationed for the longest (typically [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]]).
