The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are the signature military units of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Amira\|Amiran]] tradition. They are known to be highly mobile, disciplined, and deadly, and typically assume positions of command within the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Places/Imperial Academy\|Imperial Academy]]. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Legionaries]] are usually (but not exclusively) [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Amira\|Amiran]] members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Army\|Imperial Army]] who have proven themselves with exceptional skill and loyal service. 

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] always receive their training in [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Vernug Macht/Vernug Macht\|Vernug Macht]]. All prospective [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|legionaries]] must be able to pass a series of aptitude exams before they can be admitted to [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Vernug Macht/Vernug Macht\|Vernug Macht]]. The very best of the best of these cadets compete for an invitation to participate in exclusive training at [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Castelyr/Castelyr\|Castelyr]]. There, aerial cavalry specialists known as [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Wyrmriders\|Wyrmriders]] may hone their skills and learn the ancient ways of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Wyrmriders\|dragoon]].  

Once their training is complete, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are frequently stationed in settlements along the coast in order to defend the national borders. In times of conflict, it is common for [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|legionaries]] to serve as commanders in the field and to be posted in strategic positions on the battlefield. Wherever it is that they are stationed, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are often feared and dreaded by most of the population they serve-- even the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]]. 

Each [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legion]] is expected to lead a small, highly efficient, independent and organized military cohort, typically consisting of between one to five additional units. Once formed, this cohort is expected to train together extensively, and are strongly encouraged to develop close relationships with each other to enhance unit cohesion.
