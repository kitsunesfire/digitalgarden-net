# Praetorian Guard 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] are specialized units of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] that serve as personal bodyguards for the Eternian [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. They are commonly stationed in [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]] to defend the interests of the imperial crown. They also may be tasked with escorting high-ranking political officials, such as [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] or [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Ambassador\|Ambassadors]], and/or serving as bodyguards for the senior officers of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] or [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Places/Imperial Academy\|Imperial Academy]].

In addition to their combat skills, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] are known for their nearly limitless access to palace intrigues and high degree of political influence. There are a number of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] assigned to the capital garrison at all times who tend to move about in the shadows of the castle, constantly keeping watch over their charge(s). In times of conflict, it is common for the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] to serve as commanders in the field and to be posted near the senior officer's tent in camp.

The soldiers known as the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] are usually members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] who have proven themselves with exceptional skill and loyal service, and must be able to pass a series of aptitude exams before they can be admitted to the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] ranks. 

All [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] benefit from several advantages, including permission to bear arms within the city of [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]], access to a private barracks, and substantially higher pay than Eternian soldiers of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]]. This salary is also regularly augmented by subsidies of food and supplies that are typically distributed at important times for the Empire, such as a royal birth, a noble wedding, or following a failed attempted revolt. 

The mandatory service of a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] is shorter in duration than that of a soldier; 12 years with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] instead of 16 to 20 years with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]]. This early retirement is traditionally spent either in a beachside villa in [[4. Gazetteer/Auroric Shores/Hesperia/Hesperia\|Hesperia]] or an alpine chalet in [[4. Gazetteer/Evenfall Isles/Isara/Isara\|Isara]], though some may choose to remain wherever they were stationed for the longest (typically [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]]). 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]] are feared and dreaded by most of the population-- even the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]]. Despite the prestige of their position, they are often seen as being far more loyal to coin than to country, and have a reputation for being able to be bribed and corrupted.  In fact, in [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], there are some slang phrases that refer to the common experience of being blackmailed, taken advantage of, or otherwise extorted by a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]], such as "being *praed* upon" or "paying a *torian* toll".
