# Imperial Guard

The vast majority of the armed forces of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] is made up from members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]]. Not to be confused with highly trained, full-time soldiers (such as the members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]]), members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] are only obligated to serve 40 days out of the year to their assigned post; beyond this, whenever danger arises, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] is simply mustered from among the elements constituting it. As a result, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] tend to have much stronger allegiances to their town and [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] than to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. 

This was not always the case. First formed by 

the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] was created by drafting troops from the various [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] 

in a desperate attempt to reclaim control over the [[Chthonic Gates\|Chthonic Gate]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]] after [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Val'Drah\|Val'Drah]]'s extended absence caused the ancient seal over the gate to erode and fail. These troops were often only given whatever equipment they could afford and the bare minimum of combat training, but they were initiated in ancient rites that were said to have dramatically improved their effectiveness in battle against [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Extraplanar/Extraplanar\|Extraplanar]] beings; when there were [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] outbreaks across [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] during the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]], this preparation proved its worth tenfold, ultimately sparing the continent from the same magnitude of [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] that plagued (and nearly destroyed) the rest of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]].

Over the next hundred years, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] made full use of their advantages-- not only holding their ground against the [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]], but expanding their sphere of influence. Under the leadership of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Radegonde von Aegir\|Radegonde von Aegir]], the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] (supported by the elite [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Praetorian Guard\|Praetorian Guard]]) launched an invasion into their formerly allied territories, leading first to the surrender of 

and then the annexing of 

into the newly declared [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] in what is now known as [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]].  

However, in the time since, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] has gotten rather complacent. They were never terribly well known for being highly trained or disciplined, but the decades of relative peace and security during the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Destiny\|Age of Destiny]] caused many to abandon the sword and turn to more lucrative trade.

Now that the beasts in the wilds have been growing inexplicably and increasingly savage, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] has been called upon once more to keep the dangers at bay. But times have changed, and for many, the command of their [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] has fallen upon deaf ears, with the threat of punishment or imprisonment in [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]] not enough to belay the fear of death at the hands of whatever dark creatures now haunt their lands (and seas). 

There are a brave and mighty few, however, who remember what it once was to be a member of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]], and do their own small part to keep that honor alive. Should those sparks be nurtured into flames, there's no telling just what the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] may be capable of.
