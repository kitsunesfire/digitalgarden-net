While they receive a broad education on a variety of creatures and threats, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Justiciars\|justiciars]] typically specialize in eliminating [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Devil\|devils]], [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]], [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|dragons]], [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Vampyr\|vampyr]], and other monsters of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Justiciars\|Solar Justiciars]] frequently collaborate with [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]], especially in efforts related to stabilizing the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]] after a [[6. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Dark Sun\|Dark Sun]] has passed.

In most cases, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Justiciars\|justiciars]] are not paid particularly well for their efforts, and earn far more by looting what they can from the battlefield than they do by staying inside the garrison. For this reason, they tend to have a reputation of being hot-headed and eager to fight, and will often take up side jobs hunting monsters or escorting cargo caravans for some extra coin. In fact, many [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Justiciars\|justiciars]] have turned out to be far more loyal to coin than to country-- and as a result, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Justiciars\|Solar Justiciars]] have developed a reputation for being able to be rather easily bribed and corrupted.
