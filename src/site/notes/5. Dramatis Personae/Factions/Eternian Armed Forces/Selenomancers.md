 [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Selenomancers\|Selenomancers]] are mages who are associated most strongly with divination magic, illusions, and teleportation spells. As a side effect of their training, nearly all [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Selenomancers\|Selenomancers]] end up with distinctive white eyes that softly glow in the darkness and a sensitivity to bright light. Due to the demanding and secretive nature of their training, they are almost exclusively found and trained in the ancient temple of [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Selelune/Selelune\|Selelune]].

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Selenomancers\|Selenomancers]] are typically thought of as defensive specialists and are highly valued for their lifesaving potential, though they also tend to be quite fragile and vulnerable themselves. They are commonly targeted by their enemies for those very same reasons, and over the course of history have frequently been abducted and either held for ransom or forced to work for their enemies.
