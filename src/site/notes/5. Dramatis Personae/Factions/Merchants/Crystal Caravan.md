Usually referred to simply as "the Caravan", the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]] is a traveling group mostly comprised of [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Kitsune\|Kitsune]] merchants and mystics. In some parts of the world they are also called "gypsies", though the members of the Caravan find that term offensive and distasteful. They are known worldwide as merchants of fine foods, tea, sake, and artisan goods, and are frequent trade partners with blacksmiths and swordsmiths. 

As their name suggests, they are strongly associated with their signature enchanted works of crystalline artistry such as specialty talismans, charms, wind chimes, dream catchers, or crystal balls, though they are also known to trade in a variety of black market goods (especially magic items, runestones, wine and silk). Their association with the black market frequently puts them at odds with the local authorities; thankfully, [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Unmet/Kohaku\|the head of the Caravan]] is a skilled diplomat and has spent the better part of the last six years cutting various deals to keep his people (mostly) out of harm's way. 

The most significant of these deals was struck with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]], where the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]] agreed to help them establish and maintain a network of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisk\|Obelisk]] across the treacherous terrain of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. These [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisk\|Obelisk]] are meant maintain balance between the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Polarities/Polarities\|Polarities]] of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]], and, when charged, can enrich and revitalize otherwise uninhabitable terrain-- reducing or even eliminating the necessity for the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] to perform their usual [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Cleansing\|Cleansing]] rituals in those effected areas. While the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisk\|Obelisk]] themselves are a product of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] research and ingenuity, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] lacked the manpower necessary to regularly make the journeys between the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Wellspring\|Wellspring]] and the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Key Items/Artifacts/Obelisk\|Obelisk]] to recharge them; on the other hand, in exchange for the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]]'s personnel and extensive travel networks, this deal granted them the legitimacy and prestige they desired and allowed them to conduct their affairs more-or-less freely throughout the Empire. While this has improved their standing with most of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]], it has soured their relationship with the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Noble Houses/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] rather significantly, making travel through the [[4. Gazetteer/Gaean Heartlands/Gaean Heartlands\|Gaean Heartlands]] more of a hassle than it used to be.
