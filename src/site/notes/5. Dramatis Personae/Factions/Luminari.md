*Lux Ab Aeterno*: the light of the beginning 

Despite a not-insignificant contingency of people who believed (and still believe) that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] are best left alone, there were some long ago who decided that the potential benefits were simply too powerful to ignore. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] were an ancient people who were fascinated with the cosmos and became masters of summoning magic and [[7. Scholarly Details/Science/Alchemy/Alchemy\|alchemy]]. They practiced a primordial, shamanic type of magic that allowed them to study and interact with various aspects of [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]], including the esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] of creation. Through their unique rituals and traditions, they not only gained the power to summon powerful cosmic allies known as [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeons]], but also discovered the means to transmute an [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon's]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Essences/Essences\|essence]], thereby binding them to the summoner's will. The people who were able to perform these powerful and sacred rituals, known simply as [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]], have been little more than the subject of distant myths and archeological intrigue for hundreds of years, and their arcane arts were thought to be lost until the ages-- until the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] somehow revitalized these practices in their [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] work. 

The traditions of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]], sometimes described as "the secrets of enlightenment", were initially celebrated and honored... but what is divine to one man is demon to another, and over time, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] practices grew to be feared, forbidden, and then forgotten. After a frenzy of "witch hunts"  completely dismantled their once proud and vibrant civilization, all that remains are fragments of hieroglyphic writings on crumbling papyrus and mysterious artifacts that can occasionally be recovered from the ruins (and skeletons) they left behind. 

It is from some of these recovered writings that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] got their start. In fact, in many ways, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] can be seen as the predecessors of the modern-day [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Church of the Celestine]], having indirectly taught them much of what they know. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] view the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] as a more advanced and enlightened society, tragically cut short by the ignorance of mankind. They seek to pick up where the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] left off and succeed where they failed, ultimately guiding humanity back towards the light.
