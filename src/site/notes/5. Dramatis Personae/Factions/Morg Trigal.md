# Morg Trigal

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Morg Trigal\|Morg Trigal]] is an abnormally large war band of goblins, orcs, kobolds and worgs. A war chief and shaman priestess are said to lead the horde, though reports about this group are inconclusive and often contradictory. 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Morg Trigal\|Morg Trigal]] live in dwellings and caves scattered across the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]]. Each dwelling typically holds a tribe of up to 20 members. These different tribes are frequently at odds with each other, usually over hunting territory. Long-standing feuds are common amongst the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Morg Trigal\|Morg Trigal]], and more often than not get other villages and populations caught up in the cross-fire.
