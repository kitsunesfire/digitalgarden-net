 The existence of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Crystal Bearers\|Crystal Bearers]] is a tightly kept secret. They are the result of [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] experimentation (particularly that which is conducted in [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]]) as part of a larger effort to maximize the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] (or, more specifically, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]) that can be generated within a subject. 

Not all people who participate in [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] rituals become [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Crystal Bearers\|Crystal Bearers]]. Specifically, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Crystal Bearers\|Crystal Bearers]] are individuals who, after participating in an [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] ritual where their [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] has been modified, have had some portion of their [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] crystallized. This causes [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Aether Crystal\|aether crystals]] to form on (or within) their bodies, usually creating a geode-like scar on their body or turning entire parts of their bodies into crystal. In some cases, this may create an unusual chain reaction within the subject where, perhaps to compensate in some way for this alteration, they end up generating far higher than normal amounts of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]. 

While this result is highly desirable for the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]], it is also extremely difficult to achieve. More often than not, the subject suffers from a different, less desirable mutation instead... or simply ends up dying. In fact, even when the subject survives the procedure and has successfully been made into a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Crystal Bearers\|Crystal Bearer]], they usually only live for a relatively short time before either dying or becoming [[7. Scholarly Details/Medicine/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]]. For this reason, most of the research related to [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Crystal Bearers\|Crystal Bearers]] has been only conducted at the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] laboratories within [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]], where test subjects are plentiful and unlikely to be reported missing when things (inevitably) go wrong.
