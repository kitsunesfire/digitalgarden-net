# The Triumvirate Council

Instead of appointing any [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] within their territory, the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are represented and led by their own [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Triumvirate Council\|Triumvirate Council]]. Usually, one of the three council members also serves in the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]. The result of this governance tends to mean that the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/High Elf/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are overall poorer, with less access to luxury trade goods and standard issue equipment, but also pay less in taxes and have more personal freedoms than average citizens of other [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]].
