# The Ennead

Formally known as "The Ennead of Eternia", the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] is comprised of seven [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]], each representing a [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] within the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. Other than the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Consort\|Consort]], they are seen as the strongest and most capable representatives of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]].

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] hold a number of executive and legislative responsibilities within the Empire. Generally, they act as council for the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] and their [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Consort\|Consort]], advising them on a number of subjects and keeping them informed on the current events within their [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]]. They are also responsible for enforcing [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|the Empire]]'s rule of law within their [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]], and their word is generally seen as an extension of the will of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. 

Most importantly, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] are ultimately the ones who determine (and themselves are most likely to become) [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]'s next [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]. Under normal circumstances, upon either the death or abdication of a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]], there is a competition called the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] held between [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|candidates]] for the throne-- usually including members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] themselves. At the conclusion of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Local Customs/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], a winner is chosen. This individual becomes the new heir apparent to the Zarthurian throne, who is then presented to the public in an elaborate ceremony that marks the official start of their rule. In [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], this final step of confirmation is called "ascension". 

Outside of this appointment procedure, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]'s most significant task is to function as the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]'s council. While the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] is free to ignore any advice the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] offers, the prestige of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] often makes the advice they offer difficult to ignore. While only the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] can make new laws, they often involve the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] and/or the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Magistrate Assembly\|Magistrate Assembly]] in the process. 

Due to ancient laws and superstitions, there are some restrictions on where, when and how the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] is allowed to formally convene. For example, these meetings can take place either inside or outside the formal boundary of a place dedicated to one of the ancient [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] (as designated by the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Espers\|Espers]]), but no further than a mile outside of it. Additionally, before any official meeting can begin, a sacrifice to [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Madjai\|The Madjai]] must be made, and a search for divine omens must be taken. 

Members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] tend to be leaders of their respective communities, and often have significant responsibilities within their province in addition to their senatorial duties. As such, it is rare for the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] to formally convene more than is absolutely necessary-- usually only once a season in times of peace, or once a month in times of conflict-- though individual [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] may meet independently more frequently if their schedules allow. Most [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] make use of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvian Gate\|Eluvian Gate]] network to travel to and from their meeting places (and in some cases are required to do so, due to geographic restrictions and time constraints). 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] tend to wear white and gold, and are each given a circlet and a signet ring to denote their status.
