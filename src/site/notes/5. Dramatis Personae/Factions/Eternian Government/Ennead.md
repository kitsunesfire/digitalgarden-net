Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]], each representing a [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] within the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]].

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] are seen as the strongest and most capable representatives of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. They are leaders of a province within the Empire, and are each responsible for the protection and maintenance of one of the six [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Artifacts/Aether Core\|Aether Cores]]. 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] hold a number of executive and legislative responsibilities within the Empire. Generally, they act as council for the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]], advising them on a number of subjects and keeping them informed on the current events within their [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]]. They are also responsible for enforcing [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|the Empire]]'s rule of law within their [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]], and their word is generally seen as an extension of the will of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. 

Most importantly, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] are ultimately the ones who determine (and are most likely to become) [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]'s next [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]. Under normal circumstances, every six years there is a competition called the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]] held between each of the members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]. Most of the details about the nature of this competition is highly classified, but it is publicly known that collecting vast amounts of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aether]] within their [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Artifacts/Aether Core\|aether core]] can give a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] a huge advantage, and that a great deal of their stored [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aether]] is either lost or spent over the course of the contest. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] are required to participate in the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], though an archaic loophole in the law does allow for a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]] to appoint a substitute to compete in their place; this provision has very rarely been used, and is generally seen as an act of selfishness or surrender. At the conclusion of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Crown Contest\|Crown Contest]], a winner is chosen. This individual becomes known the new [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]], or the heir apparent to the Zarthurian throne.

After the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]] has been chosen, they are presented to the public and given a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]], or a "coronation period". The [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] is not one single event, but rather a long-lasting process that includes several festivals, rites, ceremonies that the candidate has to celebrate first, before he or she is allowed to wear the crown. It is customary for [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] to last for one year, but records show that in the past there have been [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] that were either significantly longer or shorter for certain rulers; no formal justification has ever been recorded for this variance. The time spent in [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] is not traditionally counted in a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Rules of Succession/Regnal Year Count\|Regnal Year Count]], for they are not considered to have "truly" begun their rule until after the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] has been completed. 

During [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]], it is customary for each of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] to issue a trial to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]]-- either to prove or to challenge their worthiness. Once the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Dokimasia/Dokimasia\|Dokimasia]] has been completed and the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] have given their final approval, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]] is confirmed by and for their public in an elaborate ceremony that marks the official start of their rule. In [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Vergehen\|Vergehen]], this final step of confirmation is called "ascension". 

Outside of this appointment procedure, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]'s most significant task is to function as the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]'s council. While the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] is free to ignore any advice the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] offers, the prestige of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] often makes the advice they offer difficult to ignore. While only the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] can make new laws, they often involve the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] and/or the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Magistrate Assembly\|Magistrate Assembly]] in the process. 

Due to ancient laws and superstitions, there are some restrictions on where, when and how the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] is allowed to formally convene. For example, these meetings can take place either inside or outside the formal boundary of a place dedicated to one of the ancient [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]], but no further than a mile outside of it. Additionally, before any official meeting can begin, a sacrifice to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Madjai\|Madjai]] must be made, and a search for divine omens must be taken. 

Members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] tend to be leaders of their respective communities, and often have significant responsibilities within their province in addition to their senatorial duties. As such, it is rare for the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] to formally convene more than is absolutely necessary-- usually only once a season in times of peace, or once a month in times of conflict-- though individual [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] may meet independently more frequently if their schedules allow. Most [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] make use of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvian\|Eluvian]] network to travel to and from their meeting places (and in some cases are required to do so, due to geographic restrictions and time constraints). 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] tend to wear white and gold, and are each given a circlet and a gold signet ring to denote their status.
