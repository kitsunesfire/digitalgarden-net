# Eternian Government

While the overall political structure of Zarthura has changed very little over its history, it came to instead be known as the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] when, at the conclusion of [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Silas\|Silas Braska]] named himself the "Immortal [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] of [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternia]]".
