# Corsairs



## Corsair Council 
The Corsair Council is the main governing body of the seas between Zarthura and the mainland, as well as the scattering of small islands within it. They tend to be extremely lenient on crime so long as their settlements and ships are not threatened, and many vices forbidden in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] are practiced openly and tolerated by the Council. 

Most, if not all, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Corsairs/Corsairs\|corsair]] captains take part in the Council in some manner, but only the votes of the most prominent members are heeded.
