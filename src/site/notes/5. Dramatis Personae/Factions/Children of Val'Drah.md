# The Children of Val'Drah

Historically a group that has been partly a draconic cult, partly a band of revolutionary folk heroes, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Children of Val'Drah\|Children of Val'Drah]] are a faction of Zarthurian loyalists who steadfastly (and stubbornly) await their Queen's return. Their numbers have waned significantly with each passing generation, and most of those who remain are either elder dragonborn well past their fighting prime or young, anti-elven anarchists who simply want to overthrow the system.
