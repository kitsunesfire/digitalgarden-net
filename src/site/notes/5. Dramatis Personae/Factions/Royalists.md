# Royalists (Black Banners)

Also commonly referred to as the Black Banners, the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalists\|Royalists]] are a faction loyal to the former Zarthurian [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarchy]]. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalists\|Banners]] believe that it was blasphemous to become an Empire, and desire to return to a time of monarchic rule. Even though the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalists\|Royalists]] support greater independence for each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]], they believe that the only way [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]] can remain united is under the central rule of a [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarch]]. Some may agree with some of the frustrations of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Republican\|Republicans]], but all see them as far too radical and reject their desire to remove the crown from Zarthurian governance. They believe that the son of the last [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]], [[5. Dramatis Personae/Key NPCs/Historic Figures/Wulfram von Durchenwald\|Wulfram von Durchenwald]], is the one true, rightful ruler of Zarthura, and seek to empower him to the throne.

Royalists are typically traditionalist, isolationist, and distrustful of foreigners. While they are definitely a minority across [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], a growing number of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|high elves]]-- especially in the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]]-- are [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Royalists\|Royalists]].
