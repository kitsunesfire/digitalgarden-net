# The Neteru

In Zarthurian mythology, there are four progenitor [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] who are responsible for having created the entirety of the known (and unknown) universe. These four [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]], known collectively as [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Neteru\|The Neteru]], are rarely worshipped directly because they are thought to be far too distantly removed from their individual creations to be moved to act on their behalf. Even so, they are held in extremely high esteem in Zarthurian faith and offerings are usually left for them in local temples... just in case.

From [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Neteru\|The Neteru]] emerge the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]]. These [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] are personifications of cosmic principles, laws, and forces of human nature that pervade the whole universe; they are the means by which [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Neteru\|The Neteru]] sustain their creations and manifest themselves. Of these nearly infinite forms, the ones most familiar to Zarthurians have been [[8.
