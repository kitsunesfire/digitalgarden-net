# Ophelia

[[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ophelia\|Ophelia]] is the Lady of Mercy. She is the twin of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Lucio\|Lucio]], the Lord of Retribution, and a daughter of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]], the Arbiter of Justice. Common myths say that both twins were born as a result of Sunan's first execution-- [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Lucio\|Lucio]] from the fire and determination in Sunan's heart in the very moment before his final judgement was rendered, and [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ophelia\|Ophelia]] from the tears in Sunan's eyes as he wept from the gravity of the task before him. There is a great deal of animosity between worshippers of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ophelia\|Ophelia]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Lucio\|Lucio]], with each tending to view the other as the weaker of the two. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ophelia\|Ophelia]] is commonly understood to be blind, and is usually depicted with some form of blindfold. Despite this, her followers believe that she sees with "more than eyes", and that in exchange for her "normal" sight is instead able to see the purity of one's spirit, which she perceives as motes of golden light emanating from within an individual's aura. There are many in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] who do not believe in the existence of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ophelia\|Ophelia]], if not for any other reason than they cannot fathom [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]] ever having been brought to tears or experiencing any form of mercy. There are others who consider the worship of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ophelia\|Ophelia]] to be a scam, with the practice simply taking advantage of those who would like to avoid rightful due process or judgement. Additionally, there are those who simply refuse to follow a blind goddess on principle, generally likening the practice of worshipping her to "the blind leading the blind". But for those who do follow her, they are said to be rewarded with eternal peace upon their death, with all their misdeeds forgiven and all of the grace they gave to others in life returned to them tenfold.
