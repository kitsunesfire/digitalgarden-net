# The Queen of Spring

>[!grid]
>![[Verenestra.png\|Verenestra.png]]

While she may look cold and distant in appearance, the Queen of Spring shows more compassion and kindness than the other three Sidhe combined. She channels the joy of spring to all around her, calming them and inducing an enthralling kindness in others. If one were to need help from an extremely powerful [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]], the Queen would be a good one to go to as she usually only asks for minor payments. She is still not forthcoming with information due to her nature and speaks in half-truths like all of her kind, but she is generally helpful and likes to see others grow with her aid. 

A fickle, vain Sidhe of charms and beauty, she generally chooses to appear as a slim female nymph, dryad, or sylph. She is always barefooted, wearing only gossamer garments to provide her with a semblance of modesty, and is always adorned with an assortment of delicate jewelry and budding flowers.

## Seasonal Effect on Arcadia 

Spring is when life returns again to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]] after the harsh, unforgiving cold of winter. Endless meadows of grass sprout from the ground, hedged by flowers and trees. A strange calmness comes over the plane during this time, as if every creature returns to that playful youthfulness where conflict comes in the form of tricks played on each other rather than bloodshed. But it is also a time of rebirth, new life and beauty. And this is often accompanied by Fae displaying aspects of narcissism, promiscuity, egotism and dilettantish pursuits.
