# Book of the Netherworld

The Book of the Netherworld is a text that has long since been lost to this world, but is often referenced in other ancient sources. Due to these references, we know that the Book of the Netherworld described the journey of the god of radiance, [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Kael Doras\|Kael Doras]], through the caverns of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. These descriptions seem to have focused on the interactions between [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Kael Doras\|Kael Doras]] and the inhabitants of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]], including rewards for the righteous and punishments for the enemies of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|fate]] and the worldly order.
