# Fundamentals of the Course of the Stars

An ancient [[6. Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] astronomical text that also covers various mythological subjects. These texts focus on the cycles of the stars, the movements of the moon and sun, and other related matters. Some of the major themes of the book are the concepts of sunrise as a mythological rebirth and sunset as the "exit" of the netherworld.

There are nine different copies of the book, and they each have various dates of authorship. Three copies have been found on monuments, and six more have been found on papyrus fragments. Currently, the papyrus fragments are scattered due to the influence and interference of adventurers and thieves in ancient burial sites over the years. The most highly prized of the manuscripts are those held in the [[6. Factions/Archive\|Archive]], due to their quality and completeness.
