# Arts & Culture

Art is central to Zarthurian culture, and nearly all Zarthurians have some experience within a field of artistic expression, whether it be in music, painting, sculpture, or craftsmanship. Zarthurians believe that [[7.

Zarthurian art tends to be avant garde with focus on natural themes, often including expressive depictions of the forests, stars, and the elements.

Music is also a vital part of Zarthurian life, with melodies that seem to echo the natural rhythms of the world. Zarthurian instruments are crafted with experimental and found materials, their sounds often carrying one-of-a-kind melodies. Zarthurian songs often tell the stories of their people, the deeds of their ancestors, and the mysteries of the cosmos.
