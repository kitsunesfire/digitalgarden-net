# Fredja

[[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Fredja\|Fredja]] is remembered as one of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]]. Also known as the Sage of Ages, [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Fredja\|Fredja]]'s study of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] enabled her to safely dismantle the corrupted segments of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] and rebuild it even stronger than before. With [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Fredja\|Fredja]]'s version of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] in tact, [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/The Primordial Spirits\|The Primordial Spirits]] were now able to interact with [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] once more, reinvigorating and enriching each of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Primordial Sources\|Primordial Sources]]. It is because of her efforts that magic such as [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] are once again possible to practice in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]].
