# Heroes of Prophecy

The [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Heroes of Prophecy\|Heroes of Prophecy]] ([[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Anka\|Anka]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Fredja\|Fredja]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Oleander\|Oleander]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Raymundo\|Raymundo]], and [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Heroes of Prophecy/Tayla\|Tayla]]) are the five heroes who saved [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] when they confronted the Wild Hunt and stopped Ragnarok. Through their combined efforts, the spread of [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] was slowed (and even became somewhat treatable), [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]] was healed, and the flow of primal magic to and from each of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Primordial Sources\|Primordial Sources]] was restored.
