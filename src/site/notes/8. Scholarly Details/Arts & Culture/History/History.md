# History

Zarthura is currently a monarchy ruled by an [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. Its capital city is [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]], the most populated city anywhere outside of the mainland of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. 

Zarthura has been ruled by [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarchs]] since its foundation, though the title of this reigning [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarch]] has changed from [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Tzar\|Tzar]] to [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] to [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] over the years. Unlike other monarchies (the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] monarchy, for example), the Zarthurian monarchy has rarely been hereditary, with each subsequent [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarch]] typically hailing from an entirely different lineage. Even so, it is true that the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|heir to the throne]] is generally selected from amongst the members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] (particularly those representing the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]], the [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Lunar Highlands\|Lunar Highlands]] and the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]]), so the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Rules of Succession/Rules of Succession\|path to succession]] isn't realistically that much broader here than anywhere else. 

Under the Zarthurian monarchy, each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] is governed by a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senator]]. While the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] are expected to uphold the law of the crown, they are granted a large degree of autonomy over how they rule over their territory. For instance, even though, *officially*, only the crown has the right to make new laws or to change existing ones, it has been common in Zarthurian history for [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] to create and enforce provincial laws of their own without the involvement (or even direct approval) of the capital. Therefore, while some aspects of Zarthurian culture and custom remain universal, each [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|province]] has over time developed its own distinct sub-culture.

As the kingdom re-established itself, it underwent a number of reforms. One of the first was the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Immer Wahrend Act\|Immer Wahrend Act]], which formally relocated the capital from [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Surrse Kasteel/Surrse Kasteel\|Surrse Kasteel]] back to [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]]. Another early reform was the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Adeldom Act\|Adeldom Act]], which dramatically limited the independence of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]] and enforced more standardized laws and practices across the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]], including regulating the means of appointing [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]]. Later, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Ionius Accord\|Ionius Accord]] put into law the rights and responsibilities of citizens and immigrants within the Empire, and established the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Auxilia\|Auxilia]] in the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]]. After decades of lobbying, one of the more controversial reforms, [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/The Bill of Embers\|The Bill of Embers]], only went into effect very recently; this bill removes the standard Imperial restrictions on spellcasting if a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/State of Emergency\|State of Emergency]] has been declared, effectively pardoning a mage from otherwise [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Illegal Magic\|criminal acts]] (such as catching civilians in magical crossfire, performing mind control on members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]], or performing non state-sanctioned resurrections, for example). 

While the political structure of Zarthura has changed very little over its history, it came to instead be known as the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] when, at the conclusion of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|The War of Bleeding Shadows]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Silas\|Silas Braska]] named himself the "Immortal [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] of [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternia]]".
