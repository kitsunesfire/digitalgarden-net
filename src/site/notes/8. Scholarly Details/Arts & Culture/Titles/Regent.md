# Regent

A [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]] is an individual who assumes the role of ruling in the name of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] when the rightful ruler is unable to govern effectively. A [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] may only have a single [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]] appointed at any given time, though they are theoretically free to reassign the title any time they please; in practice, such reassignment is a very unusual and rare event. 

The appointment of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]] is crucial to maintaining stability and a smooth transition of power during periods of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Rules of Succession/Regency\|Regency]]. After all, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]] must possess the necessary qualities of wisdom, leadership, and loyalty to the monarchy, and must be able to be entrusted with the responsibility of upholding the best interests of the realm while safeguarding the throne until the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Crown Candidate\|Crown Candidate]] can ascend. 

In [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]] to the throne has almost always been a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s spouse. As such, the marriage of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] is a hugely public affair, with a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s choice of spouse highly scrutinized. In some cases, a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] has appointed a trusted advisor as their [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]] instead, though this usually only happens if the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]] is unmarried; if they were to have a spouse whom they do not name [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Regent\|Regent]], this would be seen as a huge insult to the spouse and call into question the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]]'s judgement and priorities.
