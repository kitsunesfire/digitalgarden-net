An [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|Arcanimist]] is a person who practices [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]]. [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|Arcanimist]]s are said to seek to turn the “lead” of the human essence into the “gold” of enlightenment, ever striving to be closer to the stars. [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|Arcanimists]] are usually, but not always, also members of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] Church. Also known as "spiritual alchemists" or "astral workers", ethical debates have frequently surrounded their work, with some approaching it cautiously due to the potential risks of interacting with powerful entities. Others, however, view it merely as a means of inner transformation and self-empowerment. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] is believed to help the practitioner and their subjects develop both the physicality and the mental/emotional insights necessary to purify themselves and connect with the Holy [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]]. To that end, arcanimists are expected to seek to transform "common" and "unwanted" circumstances into more "noble" ones. They often work to facilitate shifts from lack to abundance; from poor health to wholeness; from weakness to strength; from sadness to joy, and more. For these reasons, arcanimists are often viewed as saintly miracle workers and bringers of good fortune, though there are some who see their work as a "corruption of the natural order".
