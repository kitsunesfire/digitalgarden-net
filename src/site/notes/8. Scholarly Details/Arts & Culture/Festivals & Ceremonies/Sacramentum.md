# Sacramentum

A [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Festivals & Ceremonies/Sacramentum\|Sacramentum]] is a solemn oath or vow that renders the swearer "given to the gods" should they violate it. It is referred to as the most sacred of bonds, and cannot be undone. A [[8.

It is common practice in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] to require a new citizen to make a [[8.
