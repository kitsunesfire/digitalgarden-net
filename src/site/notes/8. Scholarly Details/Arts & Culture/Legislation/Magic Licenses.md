> Please note that magic licenses are not issued or required in the territories of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], and therefore are largely irrelevant for the purposes of this campaign. The information that follows has been retained in this guide for worldbuilding purposes, but should not have any real bearing on your current characters past their prologue. 

A magic license is a legal document that permits an individual to perform magical research or use magic itself without incurring the attention of the Templars (especially Seekers). This license signifies that the holder is a fully-fledged and officially approved wizard. It is usually written on parchment or vellum, often in a leather folder or watertight container, and kept with the wizard at all times. Any law officer, administrator of a magical academy, Guildmaster, or nobleman may demand to see this license, and any wizard unable to produce one may be lawfully placed under arrest and detained as a threat to public safety. 

Most reputable schools of magic in Sharum Mal'Kari nowadays will require a prospective student to obtain a provisional license before they can begin their studies, with a proper license to be issued after they have progressed to a satisfactory level of training. However, there are still a few in operation that have no such requirement.
