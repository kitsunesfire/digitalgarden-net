Magical energy exists throughout the multiverse and flows within and without all aspects of reality. In places where this magical energy flows particularly strongly, it takes the form of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]]: potent conduits of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]] that flow throughout the cosmos. Magical energy travels through ley lines much like blood flows through the veins of living creatures. [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] transcend physical form and can be found throughout the universe, through entire worlds, and even across realms.

Each ley line carries its own specific manifestation of magical energy. One ley line might contain the power to enhance divinations, while another forms a channel for the destructive power of fire. Regardless of a ley line's specific nature, its presence influences the world around it in subtle or overt ways.

Though magical [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]] permeates the multiverse, it rarely concentrates in high enough volume to form a ley line, and as such, [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] are rare, inscrutable phenomena. Those who overtax a ley line might find that its power fades, reroutes, or even backfires. [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] impact the world around them in considerable ways and usually manifest magical side effects that relate to their nature, such as increased ambient temperatures or prevalent brushfires along a ley line attuned to fire magic. 
  
Tapping into [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] often provides benefits that alter spells, akin toÂ [metamagic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=107). As such, spellcasters are the most likely to seek out and tap [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]], but some [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] provide benefits that anyone capable of tapping into them can use.  

The stability of any gateway between realms (including [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvian\|Eluvian]]) appears to be linked to the presence of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] -- therefore, the most powerful and most stable of gateways tend to be constructed on [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines#Nexes\|nexes]]. However, should one of these gateways be destroyed, it also leads to the eruption of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|nexus]], which is believed to be what causes the catastrophic events known as [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]].
