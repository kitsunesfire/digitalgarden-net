A [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]] is the point at which multiple [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] intersect. Incredibly rare and powerful, a [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]] can provide those who tap into them access to all of the intersecting [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]]' abilities, and they usually produce one or more additional effects based on the combination of intersecting [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]]. A nexus' level is equal to that of the highest-level [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|ley line]] that intersects at the nexus. Enterprising individuals sometimes seek out a [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]] as sites to perform [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Rituals\|Rituals]]; such locations are jealously guarded by those who wish to claim the nexus's power.

The stability of any gateway between planes (including [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Eluvian\|Eluvian]]) appears to be linked to the presence of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] -- therefore, the most powerful and most stable of gateways tend to be constructed on a [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|Nexus]]. However, should one of these gateways be destroyed, it also leads to the eruption of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Nexus\|nexus]], which is believed to be what causes the catastrophic events known as [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]].
