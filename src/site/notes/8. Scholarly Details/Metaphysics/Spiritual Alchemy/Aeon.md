# Aeon

[[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] are powerful [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aethereal]] beings who can only be summoned by [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]]. While they are unique in terms of physical appearance and abilities, [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeons]] share some similarities in that they tend to strongly resonate with a particular [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aethereal]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aspects\|aspect]] and/or [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|essence]], and possess related magical talents (which they are able to bestow upon their [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|bonded]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Scion\|scion]]). For one reason or another, [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] also tend to have a strong association with astral magic and celestial themes, leading some to believe that the nature of their summoning interacts in some way with [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/The Astral Sea/The Astral Sea\|The Astral Sea]] (rather than [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]], as is the standard with most summoning magic). [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] usually have humanoid bodies which are entirely composed of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]], and are said to have potent natural healing abilities, including a limited capacity to regenerate. According to ancient writings, many (if not all) [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeons]] may be able to transform themselves into an even more powerful form by absorbing massive amounts of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|akasha]].

Their presence in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] is a result of certain [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] rituals, such as those practiced by the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]]. In modern times, [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] cannot be perceived by mortal senses except by [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|Spiritualists]] and others with particularly high resonance and/or specialized training. [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] typically communicate with each other (and with [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|Spiritualists]]) via telepathy.

## Aeons and Eidolons 

While similar in many ways, [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] differ from Eidolons in that summoned [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] are permanently linked via [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] to a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Scion\|Scion]]. Previous attempts to sever this connection under laboratory settings have been catastrophic, usually resulting in a traumatic (and often explosive) destruction of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]]. Following the [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Principle of Equivalent Exchange\|Principle of Equivalent Exchange]], this loss of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]] tends to trigger the eruption of a [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Wellspring Magic Zone\|wellspring]] of chaotic magical energy as the universe attempts to rapidly replace the spontaneous loss of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]].

## Aeons in the Celestine Church 

The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] view [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeons]] as guardian spirits gifted to them by [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]] to use as "tools" for [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Apotheosis\|apotheosis]]. They believe that [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeons]] are immaterial in their "true" form, and that any transition from an immaterial to material form is caused by flaws, passions, or sins. They would say that the ultimate end for a materialized [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]] is to "repent" by undoing their sin of material existence and returning to an immaterial form.
