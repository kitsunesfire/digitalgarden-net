# Parts of the Soul

The ancient [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] believed that a soul (or, as they would refer to it, "[[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Psyche\|psyche]]") was made up of many parts. In addition to these components of the psyche, there was the human body (called the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Sarx\|sarx]], meaning approximately "sum of bodily parts"). 

According to [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] creation myths, the god [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]] created the primordial world out of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Tenebrae\|Tenebrae]]'s chaos utilizing their own magic. Because the world was created with magic, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] believed that the world was imbued with magic and so was every living thing upon it. When humans were created, that magic took the form of the psyche-- an eternal force which resided in and with every mortal being.

The details surrounding the concept of the psyche and the parts which encompass it have varied from scholar to scholar, but most sources agree on the following components: 

- [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Bhumi\|Bhumi]], or the physical body
