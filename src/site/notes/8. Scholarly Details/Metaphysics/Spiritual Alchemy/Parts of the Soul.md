# Parts of the Soul

The ancient [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] believed that a soul (or, as they would refer to it, "[[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Psyche\|psyche]]") was made up of many parts. In addition to these components of the psyche, there was the human body (called the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Sarx\|sarx]], meaning approximately "sum of bodily parts"). 

According to [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] creation myths, the god [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]] created the primordial world out of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Tenebrae\|Tenebrae]]'s chaos utilizing their own magic. Because the world was created with magic, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] believed that the world was imbued with magic and so was every living thing upon it. When humans were created, that magic took the form of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Psyche\|psyche]]-- an eternal force which resided in and with every mortal being.
