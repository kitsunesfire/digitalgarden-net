Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]], usually taking some manner of spectral form. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] are typically overcome by malice and often begin to resent the living; in the end, all [[8.

Similarly, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]] can also decide to [[8.
