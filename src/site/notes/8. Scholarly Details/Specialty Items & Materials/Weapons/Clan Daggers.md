# Clan Daggers

Few Johtans are seen without their [clan dagger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=13) strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a Johtan's birth and bears the insignia of their clan-- usually etched either in a glass panel or a gemstone embedded in the hilt. A parent uses this dagger to cut the infant's umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood. 

Superstitions dictate that Johtans who are traitors or cast out of their clan are to have their clan tattoos scarred over with their clan dagger, which is then surrendered to be destroyed. 

All characters from the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]] get one [clan dagger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=13) of their clan for free, as it can be assumed they carry the one given to them at birth. Selling this dagger for any reason is a terrible taboo that can earn the distain and distrust of other Johtans. Unlike the PF2e entry, clan daggers in Sharum Mal'Kari do not have the [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Dwarf\|Dwarf]] trait as they do not have any particular association with the dwarven ancestry.
