# Ambrosia

While mortals need food and drink to survive, immortals such as [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Extraplanar/Seraph\|seraphs]] have no such requirement. Though they may occasionally choose to partake all the same, for the sake of tradition, revelry, or politeness when offered, there are no earthly substances that can compare to the delicacy that is [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Ambrosia\|Ambrosia]]. 

Named for [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ambrose\|Ambrose]], one of the ancient deities of seduction, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Ambrosia\|Ambrosia]] is an amber liquor whose flavor simply cannot be described. Some say its qualities adapt to the imbiber, tasting of whatever is the richest, most delicious substance that their imagination can conjure. Others say it only gains its potency once it has been transferred to another through a selfless act of giving. Thus, it is particularly popular as an offering to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|gods]], or as a wedding or housewarming gift for the wealthy and well-connected. 

At present, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Ambrosia\|Ambrosia]] is only known to be able to be produced in one of two places: the distant, rolling hills of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]], and an ancient monastery in the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Immermehr/Immermehr\|Immermehr]] region of the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]].
