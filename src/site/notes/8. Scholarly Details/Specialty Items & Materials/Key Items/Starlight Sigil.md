A [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|Starlight Sigil]] is the mark of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|Spiritualist]], indicating that a [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] has been successfully formed. [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|Sigils]] usually take the same shape on both the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Scion\|scion]] and the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]], though some variances in positioning or scale have been known to occur. 

When a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Scion\|Scion]] activates their powers, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|sigil]] on both halves of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Syzygy\|Syzygy]] will glow with a light that is reminiscent of soft starlight (hence the name); the underlying tone is usually silver or gold, but may lean subtly into other chromatic hues. As long as the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|bonded]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic.

While dormant, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|sigil]] looks like (and is easily mistaken as) a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starscar\|starscar]].
