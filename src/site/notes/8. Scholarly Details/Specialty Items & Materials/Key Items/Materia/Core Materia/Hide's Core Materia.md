# Hide's Core Materia

**Aspects**: Forge, Artistry 

### Minor Gift: Muse 
The relic guides you in your art like a muse, giving you inspirational ideas and providing an item bonus to [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) or [Performance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=12) checks. (Choose one. If your relic allows you to do so, you can take this gift again to choose the other.) If the relic is 3rd level or higher, you gain a +1 item bonus. Once the relic attains 9th level, the bonus increases to +2. The bonus increases to +3 when the relic is 17th level.

### Minor Gift: Creative Spark 
**Activate** [two-actions] command, Interact; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You strike the relic against a piece of flint and summon a [fire wisp](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1144) to assist you, which appears in an unoccupied square next to you. The fire wisp doesn't act in combat, but it can assist you while you [Craft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=43) items. You gain a +1 bonus to [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) checks involving blacksmithing and general metalworking, increasing to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 17th level. Once per day, when you roll a critical failure on a Crafting check related to blacksmithing, you get a failure instead. The wisp replaces the need for a forge while blacksmithing, but you still require other equipment and tools. The wisp remains for up to 10 minutes or until you Dismiss it. You can extend this duration by an additional 10 minutes if you feed the wisp one light Bulk worth of charcoal or firewood, or one pint of oil.

### Major Gift: Enthralling
**Activate** [two-actions] command, envision; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You speak at length about or demonstrate your craft, or you enact a performance. The relic casts [_enthrall_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=104) at a level equal to half its own. If you have legendary proficiency in [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) or [Performance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=12), creatures can't critically succeed on their saves against this spell. You can use Sustain an Activation to sustain the effect as you would the spell.

### Major Gift: Elements of Creation 
When you activate creative spark, you can choose to summon an [air wisp](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1142), a [water wisp](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1145), and an [earth wisp](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=1143) in unoccupied squares next to you, in addition to the fire wisp. Unlike a typical earth wisp, the summoned earth wisp takes the form of a small iron creature resembling an anvil crossed with a horned beetle. Like the fire wisp, these additional wisps don't act in combat but can assist you while you [Craft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=43) items. While all four wisps are assisting you, the bonus you gain from creative spark is doubled, and your outcome for [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) checks related to blacksmithing is one degree of success better than your roll. In addition, being assisted by all four wisps replaces the need for any equipment other than blacksmithing tools when crafting metal items. The wisps last for up to 10 minutes or until you Dismiss them all together as an action. If you extend the duration of the fire wisp, it also extends the duration for the other wisps.

### Grand Gift: Artistic Perfection 
Your relic enhances your skill with [Crafting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=4) or [Performance](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=12). (Choose one.) If you succeed at a check with the chosen skill, you get a critical success instead.
