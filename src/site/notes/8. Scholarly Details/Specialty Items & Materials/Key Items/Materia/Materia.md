[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are small orbs of concentrated magical energy. There are ten types of standard [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] ([[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Air/Air\|Air]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Fire/Fire\|Fire]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Ice/Ice\|Ice]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Lightning/Lightning\|Lightning]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Metal/Metal\|Metal]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Radiant\|Radiant]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Stone/Stone\|Stone]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Water/Water\|Water]], and [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Wood/Wood\|Wood]]), as well as the far more rare (and more powerful) untyped version, known as [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]]. All [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are formed from [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|aether crystal shards]], and are most commonly used for aiding in various municipal tasks within the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], such as providing water, heat, ice for food preservation, and light for street lamps. They shatter after a certain amount of use, making the need for new [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] constant. 

Though [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are theoretically distributed evenly and fairly across the [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] of the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]], in practice, the wealthier and more powerful [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] get their hands on more or better quality [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]], whereas the poor have to make do with what they can get. Smuggling rings and [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Corsairs/Corsairs\|Corsairs]] often attempt to divert [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] shipments, and there is a lot of money to be made in the sale of [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] on the black market.
