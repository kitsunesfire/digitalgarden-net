Crafted as a product of the newfound partnership between researchers within the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] and the artisans of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Merchants/Crystal Caravan\|Crystal Caravan]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]] are made out of specially purified and engraved [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|aether crystal shards]]. Once harvested, rather than being crushed into dust and formed into [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia\|Materia]], these raw [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|crystal shards]] are instead carefully cut, shaped, polished, purified, and then finally etched with delicate runes that can unlock this material's true potency and potential. Unlike normal [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia\|Materia]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Prima Materia\|Prima Materia]] is "unaspected", meaning it has the theoretical potential to absorb, store, and expend any type of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aether]].
