# Aeonic Disrupter

Aeonic disrupters are used to disable [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualist]] abilities-- chiefly their ability to call upon a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|bound]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]]. The carefully arranged [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|aether crystal shards]] used in the crafting of these devices prevents [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] from flowing in its usual patterns, stopping an [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeon]] from being able to manifest. Aeonic disrupters may take many forms, but are usually seen as a set of shackles or similar restraints. Crafting [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Artifacts/Aeonic Disrupter\|aeonic disrupters]] is difficult and costly in both materials and skill, so they are very rare.
