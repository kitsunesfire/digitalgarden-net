A common term for the pale, scar-like marking that mysteriously appears on those who participate in [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] rituals. This marking is normally shaped like either a cluster of chaotic, galactic swirls, a fine-line, delicate constellation, bold, sweeping [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Runes/Astral Runes\|Astral Runes]] or intricately overlapping geometric patterns; there does not appear to be any deeper significance behind the type of design or the nature of its constituent symbols, other than the possibility that certain [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Arcanimist\|Arcanimists]] may have a "signature" of sorts that they bestow upon their subjects. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starscar\|Starscars]], in general, are viewed very similarly to plastic surgery-- celebrated and even envied in some circles, while mocked or concealed in others. In most cases, a little makeup is all that is required to conceal an unwanted [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starscar\|Starscar]], though those with magical talents may be able to detect their faint magical aura. 

In rare cases, a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starscar\|Starscar]] is more than just a marking. For some, it is a physical manifestation of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|bond]] forged with a powerful entity known as an [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]]. In these cases, it is more accurate to call the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starscar\|Starscar]] a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starlight Sigil\|Starlight Sigil]], for it glows like starlight when it's powers have been activated (and has other capabilities that distinguish it from a normal [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Starscar\|Starscar]]).
