A flower known by many names, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Plants & Fungi/Amaryllis\|Amaryllis]] are the flowers of final goodbyes. Legend has it that they appear wherever people are parting ways for good, and in ancient ruins, there have been descriptions and depictions of these flowers guiding the dead through the cycle of rebirth. They are very common sights in graveyards, but not as memorials. Rather, they are frequently planted around the graves themselves to deter animals from burrowing or scavenging due to their highly poisonous stems and bulbs. This is one of many reasons [[8.

Despite these sinister associations, some alchemists have found medicinal uses for this plant When added to a compound with other plants and minerals, the bulbs lose their toxicity and instead become very potent memory enhancers.
