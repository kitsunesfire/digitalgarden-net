# Bog Myrtle

Bog Myrtle has round green leaves, with flowering cones that look like berries on them. They are sometimes used to flavor beer, but can also be crushed, burned, and inhaled to cause psychotropic effects or act as a painkiller. Afterwards, it is known to cause some heavy migraine headaches.
