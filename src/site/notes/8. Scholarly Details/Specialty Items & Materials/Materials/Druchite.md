Druchite is a dark violet ore native to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. Druchite ore can be worked into armor and weapons by applying it in delicate veins or inlaid patterns across the equipment. Druchite-veined armor grants the wearer additional defenses against creatures with darkvision.
