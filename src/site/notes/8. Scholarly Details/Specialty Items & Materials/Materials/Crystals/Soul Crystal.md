Soul crystals are traded in illicit markets-- particularly in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], where the proximity to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]] has made both their presence and production particularly plentiful. The value of any given [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Soul Crystal\|Soul Crystal]] varies, but is generally thought to be worth an amount relative to the level of a crystal's captive soul. Soul crystals are strongly associated with [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]], who commonly use these precious crystals as currency, trophies, or to empower certain magical abilities. 

Soul crystals appear in all shapes and colors, with the clarity and overall quality of the crystal often associated with the purity and quality of the soul held within. All soul crystals glow with an inner otherworldly luminescence-- some more brightly than others-- and can easily be distinguished from standard gemstones by their glistening liquid core. 

When a soul has been trapped inside a soul crystal, the target cannot be [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Resurrection\|returned to life]] through any means, even powerful magic such as a wish ritual. However, if the crystal is destroyed or the magic upon the crystal is counteracted, the soul is freed. A single [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Soul Crystal\|Soul Crystal]] cannot hold more than one soul at a time, and any attempt to do so simply wastes the attempt.
