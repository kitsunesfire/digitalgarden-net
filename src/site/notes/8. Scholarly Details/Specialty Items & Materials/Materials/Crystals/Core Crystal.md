[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]], so named both for the nature of their formation and their association with deep underground spaces, are probably the rarest and most valuable material in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] due to their ability to channel and generate [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]. Over the course of history, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Crystal Shard\|shards]] of  [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] have been utilized in a variety of ways-- usually as some sort of power source or as a magical component in a spell or ritual.

While [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] are a naturally occurring resource, once they have been depleted they can take hundreds of years (or more) to reform. When left untouched, they can grow to be larger than the size of buildings. It used to be common for [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] to be mined as soon as they were reformed, to replenish expended supply, but eventually it was discovered that a "core" of pure [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] forms at the center of each [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|core crystal]]; the larger and older the crystal, the larger and more potent its core. Therefore, it became important to instead allow the crystals to grow as large as possible, to maximize the amount of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] that could be harvested from them.  

[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] are believed to be in some way related to [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]], as they only seem to form in places deeply enriched by [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]], such as exposed [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] or deep in the planet's depths. Since [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]] is a light teal blue, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystal]] tend to also take on this color, though some variance has been known to occur in certain regions. 

Societies have concentrated around [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]], both knowingly and unknowingly, since time immemorial. In Zarthura, the borders of most [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] formed along [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystal's]] influence, and civil wars have erupted over attempts to shift the powers that control these all-important sites of power. The capital cities of related [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] usually ended up being built near-- but not on top of-- [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystal]] mines. This is because the natural magic of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] is inherently wild, unpredictable, and for some reason susceptible to emotions; it is a magic that enriches the surrounding area with potent magic which can improve the land's fertility just as easily as it can obliterate it, if influenced those with ill intent.
