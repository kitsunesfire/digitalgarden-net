Technically speaking, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|soul crystals]] are crystallized [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Pavana\|Pavana]] and/or [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Varuna\|Varuna]]. [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|Soul crystals]] tend to resemble diamonds, with the clarity and overall quality of the crystal often associated with the purity and quality of the soul held within. All [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|soul crystals]] glow with an inner otherworldly luminescence-- some more brightly than others-- and can easily be distinguished from standard gemstones by their powerful magical aura. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|Soul crystals]] are traded in illicit markets-- particularly in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], where the proximity to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]] has made both their presence and production particularly plentiful. The value of any given [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|Soul Crystal]] varies, but is generally thought to be worth an amount relative to the level of a crystal's captive soul. [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|Soul crystals]] are strongly associated with [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]], who commonly use these precious crystals as currency, trophies, or to empower certain magical abilities. 

When a soul has been trapped inside a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|soul crystal]], the target cannot be [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Resurrection\|returned to life]] through any means, even powerful magic such as a wish ritual. However, if the crystal is destroyed or the magic upon the crystal is counteracted, the soul is freed. A single [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|Soul Crystal]] cannot hold more than one soul at a time, and any attempt to do so simply wastes the attempt.
