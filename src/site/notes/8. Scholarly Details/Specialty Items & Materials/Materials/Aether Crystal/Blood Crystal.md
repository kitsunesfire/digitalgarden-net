Technically speaking, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|blood crystals]] are crystallized [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Agni\|Agni]] and/or [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Bhumi\|Bhumi]]. [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|Blood crystals]] tend to resemble garnets or rubies, and usually form in clusters that resemble droplets or scabs. All [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|blood crystals]] glow with an inner otherworldly luminescence-- some more brightly than others-- and can easily be distinguished from standard gemstones by their powerful magical aura. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|Blood crystals]] are traded in illicit markets-- particularly in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], where the proximity to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]] has made both their presence and production particularly plentiful. [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|Blood crystals]] are strongly associated with [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]], who commonly use these precious crystals as currency, trophies, or to empower certain magical abilities. 

When a being's [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Agni\|Agni]] or [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Bhumi\|Bhumi]] has been crystallized into a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|Blood Crystal]], the target generally has the duration of their life shortened; this is not believed to be able to be undone, even by powerful magic such as a wish ritual. Unlike [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Soul Crystal\|soul crystals]], a single [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|Blood Crystal]] may hold the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aether]] of multiple individuals at the same time-- however, this practice is uncommon and ill-advised, as the interaction between incompatible [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essences]] can be extremely volatile and usually deadly.
