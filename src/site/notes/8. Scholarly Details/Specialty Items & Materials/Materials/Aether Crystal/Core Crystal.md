[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] are abnormally pure, particularly large [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Aether Crystal\|aether crystals]]. These crystals are probably the most valuable material in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] due to their natural ability to store, channel and generate [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]]. Over the course of history, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|shards]] of [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] have been utilized in a variety of ways-- usually as a power source, as an ingredient in a spell or ritual, or as a magical component in the crafting of an artifact. 

While [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] are a naturally occurring resource, once they have been depleted they can take hundreds of years (or more) to reform. If the artistry of generations long gone can be taken as fact, when left untouched, these crystals can grow to be larger than the size of modern buildings. These same ancient recordings have indicated that it used to be common for [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] to be mined as soon as they were reformed, in order to replenish the expended [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Crystal Shard\|shard]] supplies, but eventually it was discovered that a "core" of pure [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] can form at the center of each [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystal]]; the larger and older the crystal, the larger and more potent its core. Therefore, it became important to instead allow the crystal's core to grow as large as possible, in order to maximize the amount of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] that could be harvested from them.  

As a result, special artifacts known as [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Artifacts/Aether Core\|Aether Cores]] were created. 

Societies have concentrated around [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]], both knowingly and unknowingly, since time immemorial. In Zarthura, the borders of most [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] formed along [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Ley Lines\|Ley Lines]] of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystal's]] influence, and civil wars have erupted over attempts to shift the powers that control these all-important sites of power. The capital cities of related [[4. Gazetteer/Provinces\|Provinces]] usually ended up being built near-- but not on top of-- [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystal]] mines. This is because the natural magic of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Core Crystal\|Core Crystals]] is inherently wild, unpredictable, and for some reason susceptible to emotions; it is a magic that enriches the surrounding area with potent magic which can just as easily improve the land's fertility as it can obliterate it, if influenced those with ill intent.
