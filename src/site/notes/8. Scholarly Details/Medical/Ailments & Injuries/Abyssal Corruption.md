# Abyssal Corruption

Most of the time, when people speak of corruption, what they are really referring to is [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Abyssal Corruption\|Abyssal Corruption]]. This form of [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] is characterized by an erosion of an individual's natural [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]], which is then replaced by an overabundance of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] within the subject. A creature suffering from [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Abyssal Corruption\|Abyssal Corruption]] may appear ghoulish or undead, and typically has little need for sleep. In more advanced cases, they may even exude dark [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] vapors, passively dealing [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|void]] and poison damage to all whom they touch or approach. These effects may also gradually corrode nearby [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|aether]], causing the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] to spread. 

Minor cases of [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Abyssal Corruption\|Abyssal Corruption]] (or exposure to [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Abyssal Corruption\|Abyssal Corruption]]) can be normally be treated with regular doses of a special alchemical formula made from the distilled essence of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Plants & Fungi/Dawn Lotus\|Dawn Lotus]]. However, once it has advanced to the point of mutating the subject, only way to treat this form of [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] is to alchemically alter the subject's [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]] to remove the excess [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] essence. In keeping with the [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Principle of Equivalent Exchange\|Principle of Equivalent Exchange]], it is also necessary to replace this essence with essence of another kind; it is an extremely complicated and delicate matter so as to avoid accidentally causing a different type of [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] in the process. In modern times, this art of [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy\|Spiritual Alchemy]] is the specialty of the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]].
