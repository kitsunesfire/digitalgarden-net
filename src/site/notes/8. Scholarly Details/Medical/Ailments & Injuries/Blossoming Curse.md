# Blossoming Curse (7)

While the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] itself is a curse, it functions mechanically more like a disease, and as such features both of these affliction traits. As long as the curse persists, a creature cannot recover from the disease, and removing the curse does not automatically remove the disease element of the affliction. Both elements must be dealt with individually before a victim suffering from the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] is safe. It is typically a 7th level affliction, but exposure to other forms or sources of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] or [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Amaryllis Poisoning\|Amaryllis Poisoning]] can change it. 

Creatures who are born in areas saturated with [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Lunar Fog\|Lunar Fog]] (or who have survived there for a long time) develop a natural immunity to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]]. The surest way for non-natives to avoid contracting the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] is by first bathing in the waters of the Moonfalls of [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Misthalen/Misthalen\|Misthalen]], and then performing a pilgrimage to make an appropriate offering to the gods at the temple of [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Selelune/Selelune\|Selelune]].

Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Blossoming Curse\|Blossoming Curse]] explodes in a burst of [[8.

This creature is typically a low-intelligence beast or dragon between 7th and 9th level, depending on the GM's whim.
