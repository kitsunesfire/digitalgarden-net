# Sunblight Radiation (15)

Caused by exposure to [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Crystals/Sunblight Crystal\|sunblight crystals]] or extended exposure to [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]] burns and dissolves the afflicted creature from within. The target cannot recover from the disease's drained or sickened condition except by magic. It is typically a 15th level affliction, but exposure to other forms or sources of [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]] can change its value. 

Creatures who are born in areas saturated with [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Solar Haze\|Solar Haze]] (or who have survived there for a long time) develop a natural immunity to [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]]. The surest way for non-natives to avoid contracting [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Ailments & Injuries/Sunblight Radiation\|Sunblight Radiation]] is by wearing a [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Sunblight Ward\|Sunblight Ward]], a piece of protective jewelry forged only in the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]].
