# Akashic

All living things can become [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] as a result of overexposure to [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]]. The [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] refer to the process of becoming [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] as "purification", as they view [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] lifeforms as being closer to divinity. A typical way to turn [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] is from being exposed to [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Lifestream\|The Lifestream]] or otherwise becoming engulfed in an [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Aetherflood\|Aetherflood]] for too long. Those with [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Aethereal Tolerance\|Aethereal Tolerance]], such as [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]], are less likely to turn [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]]-- though none are believed to be totally immune.   

The [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] tend to be stronger than average, and may spontaneously gain the ability to use magic (even if they did not have such powers previously). They usually experience mutations of their [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Bhumi\|body]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Varuna\|mind]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Pavana\|spirit]], and [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Agni\|life]] -- and usually in that order -- with their natural [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]] gradually reformed or replaced by other substances such as [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Aether Crystal\|Aether Crystal]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Aether Crystal/Blood Crystal\|Blood Crystal]], or [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Rapturous Ash\|Rapturous Ash]]. Over time, [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] entities are gradually stripped of any intelligence or sense of self, and typically become ferocious and single-minded in their aggression towards any non-akashic creature. As one's will is eroded, the afflicted may also begin to move more stiffly or erratically, as if unable to wholly control their own body. When the afflicted die, they dissipate into raw [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] and leave no corpse behind. At any stage an individual may become aware of the process happening, but there are no known methods to reverse the process once it has begun. 

Once an individual has become fully "purified", a burst of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Aether\|Aether]] surges uncontrollably around them and they suddenly transform, usually taking a new, more monstrous shape. There have been a few documented cases of the purified still exhibiting some level of autonomy, though the causes for this resistance are not yet known; in most cases, this leads to the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Akashic\|Akashic]] individual attempting to commit suicide on the spot as their last desperate act of free will to escape their cursed new existence.
