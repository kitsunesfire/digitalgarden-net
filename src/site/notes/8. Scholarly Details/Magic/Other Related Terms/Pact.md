# Pact

A [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] is a permanent link forged between two entities, usually as a result of a magic ritual. While very similar to a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]], the key difference lies in the nature of the connection-- while a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] transfers power unilaterally from one entity to another, a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Bond\|Bond]] flows in both directions. 

## Malak Pacts 

While all beings with [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] may at least some minor affinity to at least one of the eight [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|Malak Artes]], beings with an unusually high affinity, or “[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]]”, are capable of forging powerful bonds with malaks of that same [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Malak Artes/Malak Artes\|arte]]. This bond, often called a “[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]]”, is a potent charge of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] that can result in a wide variety of effects, including but not limited to enhanced strength, elemental defenses, magical capabilities, increased mobility, and an extended lifespan. Most malaks prefer to live independently, but some may choose to form a pact with a mortal. While most [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pacts]] that are formed are done so willingly, there are some who force malaks to forge a [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]], subjecting them to a long lifetime of servitude—for no matter the nature of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|pact]], the only way to break it is through death.

A [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Pact\|Pact]] between a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Malak\|Malak]] and a mortal tends to fail unless the mortal in question has high levels of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]].
