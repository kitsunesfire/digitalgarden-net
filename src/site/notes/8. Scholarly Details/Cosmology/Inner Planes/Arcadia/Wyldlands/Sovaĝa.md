The great home of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]], whose population waxes and wanes like the moon. It is here where the tribes of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]] meet at key points of the lunar arcs to negotiate claims and grievances, as well as host celebrations and rituals, though some are forbidden for outsiders to see. A small number of permanent inhabitants reside here and guard the site between festivities, though depending on the heavenly cycle, there may either be a great number of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]] along with visiting dignitaries from across the planes-- or it may be a total ghost town. Arriving at [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Sovaĝa\|Sovaĝa]] without guidance or blessing is extremely difficult (and potentially dangerous), for the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]] do not take invasion of their sacred lands lightly. Whilst [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Sovaĝa\|Sovaĝa]] is controlled collectively by the tribal chiefs and elders of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]], each pays fealty to the High Priest of the Wilds.

The exterior of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Sovaĝa\|Sovaĝa]] is ringed with layers of multilevel interlocked cycles of megaliths, inconceivably large as if placed by the gods themselves. Without a guide or blessing to show you the way, this is the most of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Sovaĝa\|Sovaĝa]] that casual travelers often ever see, generally remaining none the wiser to the civilization that hides behind the magical wards. Over uncounted millennia, the great stones have been carved and embellished by the various tribes of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]]. Within these stone circles are simple, enclosed structures, with each established tribe claiming their own associated area. When called to meet, the tribes work in collaboration to construct a gigantic, decorative tent within the henges that the main ceremonies are to take place in.

[[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Sovaĝa\|Sovaĝa]] is protected by all manner of strange wards, traps, and carefully controlled dangerous beasts. Even the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]] themselves cannot keep track of them all and occasionally lose themselves to an ancient trap, set and forgotten. The ancestors of the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]]  appear to have been able to control the strange behavior of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] to some degree; as a result, many otherwise naturally occurring hazards do not bring harm to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Sovaĝa\|Sovaĝa]].
