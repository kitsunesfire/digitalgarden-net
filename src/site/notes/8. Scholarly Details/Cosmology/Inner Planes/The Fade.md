[[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] is associated with wild, occult magic and the beings who utilize them. It is thought to be one of the original spaces carved out of the cosmos-- a place where the chaotic blends of both elemental and celestial magics have had the potential to create nearly limitless miracles and devastation. While it often is thought of as an ethereal realm of dreams, over time, [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] has also come to increasingly become associated with the presence of aberrations. 

Thanks to interference from [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]], living things that consciously travel from [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] to [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] (or "cross the veil") are only able to do so as muted, ghostly versions of themselves; a traveler crossing [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]] from a forest, for example, will typically still see some version of trees, deer, and undergrowth-- but abstract, dream-like, with a distant horizon cloaked in swirling fog. For as long as these travelers are in [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]], they technically still exist on the other side, though they will typically remain invisible and incorporeal to all but the most trained observers. A few materials are suspected to break this rule, such a lead, gold, and certain kinds of crystals, which may be able to remain solid on both sides, though thus far no living creatures have been able to reliably overcome the barriers of ethereal movement. 

The landscape here is constantly changing to emulate what is seen in the minds of mortals as they dream, copying locations, objects, people and concepts of the real world-- often in cruel and confusing ways. These copies are nowhere near consistent, and fluctuate according to the imaginations of the dreamers.
