# Citrinias

Citrinias is a term given by alchemists to "yellowness", and generally refers to priming the subject matter for its final stage. 

Philosophically, it is said to stand for the dawning of "solar light" inherent in one's being-- a sign that the reflective "lunar light" is no longer necessary, and that introspective energies are to be turned outward.
