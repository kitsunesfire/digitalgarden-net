# Advanced Processes

Though the basic [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Processes/Alchemical Processes\|Alchemical Processes]] are sufficient for most everyday production, there comes a time in every alchemist's career when they decide to work on something bigger.  To craft a Great Work it is necessary for an alchemist to follow the following steps in their work (literally and/or metaphorically):

# Nigredo

In alchemy, nigredo, or "blackness", means putrefaction or decomposition. In this stage, all alchemical ingredients must be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter.

Philosophically, it also functions as a metaphor for the "dark night of the soul", when an individual confronts the darkness inside themselves.

# Albedo

In [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]], albedo, or "whiteness", is the second of four major stages. Following the chaos of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Processes/Advanced Processes/Nigredo\|Nigredo]] stage, the Alchemist undertakes a purification in [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Processes/Advanced Processes/Albedo\|Albedo]], which is literally referred to as "ablutio"-- the washing away of impurities. This phase is intended to bring light and clarity to the subject. 

Philosophically, the albedo stage often corresponds to a shift in consciousness, where the world becomes more than just about an individual's ego, family, or country.

# Citrinias

Citrinias is a term given by alchemists to "yellowness", and generally refers to priming the subject matter for its final stage. 

Philosophically, it is said to stand for the dawning of "solar light" inherent in one's being-- a sign that the reflective "lunar light" is no longer necessary, and that introspective energies are to be turned outward.

# Rubedo

Rubedo is a word meaning "redness". This stage represents alchemical success, and the end of the great work. 

Philosophically, the rubedo stage entails the attempt of the alchemist to integrate the psychospiritual outcomes of the process into a coherent sense of self before their re-entry to the world. This stage may take years to compete, due to the required synthesis and substantiation of insights and experiences.
