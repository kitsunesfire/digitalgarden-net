If [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|mana]] is the science of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] is the science of materials. At its core, [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] is often seen as the art of manipulating and altering matter by using natural energy. It is the goal of many alchemists to purify, mature, alter, and perfect certain materials .However, for all that it may be mistaken as miraculous, at the end of the day, alchemy is a science-- and as such, there are some [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Principles/Alchemical Principles\|natural principles]] in place that cannot be broken.

The proper application of the craft of transmuting and purifying materials requires not only a full understanding of chemistry and ancient alchemical theory, but also a sort of natural talent towards recognizing and manipulating physical objects with energy, which in turn requires uncommon levels of intelligence and aptitude. Those remarkable individuals capable of studying and practicing [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] are known as alchemists. 

Alchemists can use scientific methods, sometimes combined with [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]], to produce a vast array of alchemical substances with many practical uses. However, even when [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]] is used as part of an [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemical Processes/Alchemical Processes\|alchemical process]], [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] is not considered [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magic\|magic]]. As such, purely alchemical items never have magical auras, nor can they be dismissed or dispelled.

Sometimes the reactions of reagents create effects that seem magical, and at other times they straddle the line between purely reactive and the inexplicable. Alchemists can infuse reagents with some of their own essence, allowing them to efficiently create short-lived alchemical items at no monetary cost. Even in these cases, alchemical items don’t radiate magic auras, instead using the alchemist’s infused essence as one additional catalyst for the item’s alchemical effects.

Although many in Sharum Mal'Kari will be familiar with the simple products of [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] that can be readily found in merchant shops, such as tindertwigs or antitoxins, some alchemists have studied many years to perfect their craft and are able to manipulate matter in many strange ways. 

[[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]] has had a great influence on Sharum Mal'Kari. Elemental weapons such as alchemist's fire and alchemical elixirs are widespread and can be used by anyone, and alchemical techniques are often used in other sciences and industries. Alchemy enables the [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Craft/Craft\|crafting]] of stronger materials for armor and weapons, black powder for guns and explosives, and even something as simple as preservatives for transporting substances long distances safely.

## Finding Alchemists

Alchemists typically live on the fringes of society-- much like tanners-- as the dangerous nature of their work makes it undesirable to situate themselves among others. Their stores are often easy to spot, with strange colored smoke billowing from their chimneys, lights dancing through the windows, and the smells of various materials brewing.
