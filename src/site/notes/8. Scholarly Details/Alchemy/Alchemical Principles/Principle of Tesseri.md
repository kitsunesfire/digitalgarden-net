In [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]], it is believed that all matter can ultimately be divided into one of four primary [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] known as the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Tesseri\|Tesseri]]. These [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] are: [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Bhumi\|Bhumi]] (Matter/Earth), [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Agni\|Agni]] (Life/Fire), [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Pavana\|Pavana]] (Spirit/Air), and [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Tesseri/Varuna\|Varuna]] (Mind/Water). Each essence has different characteristics, and also accounts for different faculties of the human experience. Alchemists believe that the human body is made of these four primary [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|Essences]]-- as well as a fifth essence that is the source of all four: the "[[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|quintessence]]" known as [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Akasha\|Akasha]] (Void/Stars).
