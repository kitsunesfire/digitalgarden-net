# Soul Binding

In theory, [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Soul Binding\|Soul Binding]] is the alchemical process of extracting a soul from a mortal body and infusing it into a vessel. Even in the most ideal circumstances this is believed to only be possible temporarily, as the empty body must remain alive for the soul not to be [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Rituals/Sending\|Sent]] (or turned into an [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Mortality & Death/Unsent\|Unsent]]). Additionally, it is highly likely that the vessel and soul will eventually reject one another as incompatible, causing untold damage to the soul in question. 

That said, all of this is speculation-- the act of [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Soul Binding\|Soul Binding]] has been taboo since the beginnings of alchemy and remains forbidden to this day... everywhere except [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], that is. In [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], it is known that some of their highest-security prisoners in [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]] are subjected to [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Soul Binding\|Soul Binding]] as part of their confinement. However, the methods by which they perform this procedure are a very well-kept secret.
