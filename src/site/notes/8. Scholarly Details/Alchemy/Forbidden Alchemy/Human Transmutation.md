# Human Transmutation

Though there have been notable attempts by alchemists in the past to perform human transmutation, this practice is explicitly forbidden. Human transmutation may include, but is not limited to:

- Alchemical resurrection
- [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy\|7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy]] 
- [[8. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Soul Binding\|Soul Binding]]
- Creation of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Artificial/Doppelganger\|Doppelganger]]s 

In Sharum Mal'Kari, these acts are all considered to be a breach of both societal and natural law, and as such, offenders are punished most severely.
