- [Q] *Lux Ab Aeterno*: the light of the beginning 

Despite a not-insignificant contingency of people who believed (and still believe) that the [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] are best left alone, there were some long ago who decided that the potential benefits were simply too powerful to ignore. [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] were an ancient people who were fascinated with the cosmos and became masters of summoning magic and [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]]. They practiced a primordial, shamanic type of magic that allowed them to study and interact with various aspects of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Cosmic Biology\|Cosmic Biology]], including the esoteric [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|Essences]] of creation. 

Though [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] likely recognized and revered a wide variety of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]]-- many of whom are represented in Zarthura's [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Mythology/Mythology\|Mythology]] and are still worshipped as [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|Local Gods]] to this day-- they honored and revered one god above all others. This god, [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]], is thought to be the oldest of all the gods and may even be the true source of all of their powers. [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] believed that through the worship of [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Genesis\|Genesis]], all of the secrets of the cosmos could finally be understood, and they devoted themselves to the illumination of these truths. 

Through their unique rituals, traditions, and their devoted worship, [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] not only gained the power to summon powerful cosmic allies known as [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|aeons]], but also discovered the means to transmute an [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Forbidden Alchemy/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon's]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Essences\|essence]], thereby binding them to the summoner's will. The people who were able to perform these powerful and sacred rituals, known simply as [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Spiritualist\|spiritualists]], have been little more than the subject of distant myths and archeological intrigue for hundreds of years, and their arcane arts were thought to be lost until the ages-- until [[5. Factions/The Celestine/The Celestine\|The Celestine]] somehow revitalized these practices in their [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Arcanimancy\|Arcanimancy]] work. 

The traditions of [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]], sometimes described as "the secrets of enlightenment", were initially celebrated and honored... but what is sacred to one man is sacrosanct to another, and over time, [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] practices grew to be feared, forbidden, and then forgotten. After a frenzy of "witch hunts"  completely dismantled their once proud and vibrant civilization, all that remains are fragments of hieroglyphic writings on crumbling papyrus and mysterious artifacts that can occasionally be recovered from the ruins (and skeletons) they left behind. 

It is from some of these recovered writings that  [[5. Factions/The Celestine/The Celestine\|The Celestine]] are said to have gotten their start. In fact, in many ways, [[5. Factions/The Luminari/The Luminari\|The Luminari]] can be seen as the predecessors of the modern-day [[5. Factions/The Celestine/The Celestine\|Church of the Celestine]], having indirectly taught them much of what they know.
