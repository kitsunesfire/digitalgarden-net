[[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] specialize in the protection of nobles, merchants, and their interests-- while also passively collecting information on any potential threats to the crown. Individual members of [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] are referred to as [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Agent\|agents]]. [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Tzar\|Tzar]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Eyvora Ackermann\|Eyvora Ackermann]] first established [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] as her own personal guards (and spies) over 1,000 years ago, and modern-day [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Agent\|agents]] carry on these very same traditions to this day. 

[[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Agent\|agents]] are not generally thought of as front-line combatants, but what they may lack in physical power and endurance they more than make up for with ingenuity. [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] are strongly associated with the mastery of [[7. Scholarly Details/Alchemy/Alchemy\|Alchemy]]-- especially poisons-- and are known to receive extensive training in mental magic. They also traditionally arm themselves with [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Mithril\|Mithril]] weapons, ensuring that anyone who underestimates them meets an untimely end. 

Aside from their combat skills, [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] are also known for their nearly limitless access to palace intrigues and high degree of political influence. There are a number of [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|agents]] assigned to the capital garrison at all times who tend to move about in the shadows of the castle, constantly keeping watch over their charge(s). 

All [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Astral Aegis/The Astral Aegis\|The Astral Aegis]] [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Agent\|agents]] benefit from several advantages, including permission to bear arms within the city of [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]], access to their own private barracks, and substantially higher pay than any other Eternian soldiers of the [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Imperial Army\|The Imperial Army]]. This salary is also regularly augmented by subsidies of food and supplies that are typically distributed at important times for the Empire, such as a royal birth, a noble wedding, or following a failed attempted revolt.
