[[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|The Lunar Legions]] are the signature military units of [[5. Factions/The Amira/The Amira\|Amiran]] tradition.

Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|Legionaries]] are usually (but not exclusively) [[5. Factions/The Amira/The Amira\|Amiran]] members of the [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Imperial Army\|The Imperial Army]] who have proven themselves with exceptional skill and loyal service. 

[[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|The Lunar Legions]] always receive their training in [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Vernug Macht/Vernug Macht\|Vernug Macht]]. All prospective [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|legionaries]] must be able to pass a series of aptitude exams before they can be admitted to [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Vernug Macht/Vernug Macht\|Vernug Macht]]. The very best of the best of these cadets compete for an invitation to participate in exclusive training at [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Castelyr/Castelyr\|Castelyr]]. There, aerial cavalry specialists known as [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Wyrmriders/The Wyrmriders\|The Wyrmriders]] may hone their skills and learn the ancient ways of the [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Wyrmriders/The Wyrmriders\|dragoon]].  

Once their training is complete, [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|The Lunar Legions]] are frequently stationed in settlements along the coast in order to defend the national borders. In times of conflict, it is common for [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|legionaries]] to serve as commanders in the field and to be posted in strategic positions on the battlefield. Wherever it is that they are stationed, the [[5.

Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Senator\|Senators]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]]. 

Each [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Lunar Legions/The Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legion]] is expected to lead a small, highly efficient, independent and organized military cohort, typically consisting of between one to five additional units.
