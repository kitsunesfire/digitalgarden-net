# Imperial Army

[[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Imperial Army\|The Imperial Army]] is made up of trained soldiers who have enlisted and pledged their loyalty to the [[7. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]]. In exchange for this loyalty and service, high ranking imperial soldiers often hold positions of status in their assigned settlements and may be gifted [[6. Common Knowledge/Currency & Trade/Special Currency/Gil\|gil]], plots of land, or even special political favors as they rise in status and prove their worth. 

All members of the [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Imperial Army\|The Imperial Army]] are granted free tuition to the [[5. Factions/The Imperial Academy/The Imperial Academy\|The Imperial Academy]], which they are encouraged to make use of in between their assignments. For many Zarthurians, this may be their best or only opportunity to access formal education, so it often serves as a strong motivator to join the [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Imperial Army\|army's]] ranks. Additionally, imperial soldiers (and their immediate family members) have all of their medical needs tended to at [[5. Factions/The Rothschild Maximilian Clinic/The Rothschild Maximilian Clinic\|The Rothschild Maximilian Clinic]] free of charge-- which can be an enticing offer for those with significant medical needs.
