 [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Suncasters/The Suncasters\|The Suncasters]] dedicate themselves to the study of holy [[7.

[[5.

Standard [[5. Factions/The Imperial Army/The Suncasters/The Suncasters\|The Suncasters]] dress in uniforms of bronze, gold, white, and deep red. They tend to be [[7.

Factions/The Goetia/The Goetia\|Goetic]] magic, [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|void]] magic, or any other manifestations of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]] worship.
