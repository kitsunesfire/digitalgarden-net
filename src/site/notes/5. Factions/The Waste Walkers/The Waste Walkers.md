# The Waste Walkers

[[5. Factions/The Waste Walkers/The Waste Walkers\|The Waste Walkers]] are warriors who comb through the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]]. While scavenging for valuable remains, they fight off wild beasts and lesser [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]] that wander too close to the city limits. Sometimes, they may also escort wounded travelers back to civilization—for a price. 

Due to the nature of their work, [[5. Factions/The Waste Walkers/The Waste Walkers\|The Waste Walkers]] tend to attract innovators and renowned weapon smiths to their ranks. Their warriors often employ the use of experimental, dual-form weapons, such as [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Weapons/Bowblade\|bowblades]] or dual-bladed spears, and frequently make use of the rare materials they recover from the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]].
