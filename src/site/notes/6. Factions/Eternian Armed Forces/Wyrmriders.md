# Wyrmriders

The [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Wyrmriders\|Wyrmriders]] are a cavalry unit consisting of well-trained soldiers who specialize in riding wyverns in combat scenarios. Though this unit can provide tremendous aerial advantage during attack, since the threat of attack against [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] has historically been extremely rare, their primary focus usually is just to look good and impress anyone who sees them. 

Based out of [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Castelyr/Castelyr\|Castelyr]], their training exercises can occasionally be viewed up and down the northern coasts of Zarthura and throughout the peaks of the [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Lunar Highlands\|Lunar Highlands]].
