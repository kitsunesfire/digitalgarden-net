# Selenomancers

 [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Selenomancers\|Selenomancers]] are mages who are associated most strongly with divination magic. Depending on their role and aptitude, they may also specialize in illusions or teleportation spells, though these disciplines are somewhat less common. They are almost exclusively found and trained in the grand temples of [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Selelune/Selelune\|Selelune]].
