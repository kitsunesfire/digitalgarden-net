# Lunar Legions

The [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legions]] are usually made up of [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amiran]] [[6. Factions/Amira\|moon elves]], whose lithe and shadowy forms seem to sink and vanish into the darkness they call home. Their natural abilities in stealth and speed make them adept assassins and infiltrators. 

Once recruited, the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legionnaire]] is designated as Probatus and assigned to an agent to be simultaneously mentored and evaluated. After two years, if they have attracted the attentions of their superiors (either by influence or merit), they may be promoted to become a Neumond; this promotion exempts from typical daily chores and may make them eligible for specialized missions or more lucrative postings. After another two years, they become eligible to become a Halmond, with a double salary and even more important and specialized work. Only a few [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Lunar Legions\|Lunar Legionnaires]] ever attain the rank of Vollmond, but those that do tend to receive special privileges and designations as a reward for their dedicated service.
