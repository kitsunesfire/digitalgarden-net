# Auxilia

The [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Auxilia\|Auxilia]] are non-citizen troops in the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]]. Unlike their imperial counterparts, [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Auxilia\|Auxilia]] are mostly volunteers, not conscripts. While there is nothing formally forbidding a foreigner from joining one of the more specialized units (such as the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] or the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]]), more often than not, foreigners end up as one of the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Auxilia\|Auxilia]] who provide additional support to the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] instead; this is because honorable discharge from service in the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Auxilia\|Auxilia]] is one of the most common pathways towards citizenship in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]].
