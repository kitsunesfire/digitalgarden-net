# Solar Legions

The [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] are the signature warrior units of [[6. Factions/Suria\|Surian]] tradition, famed for their highly disciplined training. Based out of the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]], they are primarily (but not exclusively) comprised of [[6. Factions/Suria\|Surian]] [[6. Factions/Suria\|sun elves]]. While they receive a broad education on a variety of creatures and threats, they typically specialize in eliminating [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Devil\|devils]], [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]], [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|dragons]], [[5. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Vampyr\|Vampyr]], and other monsters of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]]. The [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] frequently collaborate with the [[6. Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]], especially in matters of healing and recovery after a [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Dark Sun\|Dark Sun]] has passed and the seal on the [[chthonic gates\|chthonic gate]] has been secured once more by the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Suncasters\|Suncasters]].

Each [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legion]] is designed to be a small, highly efficient, independent and organized military unit. Once formed, they are expected to train together extensively, and are strongly encouraged to develop close relationships with each other to enhance unit cohesion. The standard mandatory service of a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Legionary\|Legionary]] is much shorter than the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]] (between 4 and 10 years)-- though unlike the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]], most [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Legionary\|legionaries]] must put the rest of their lives entirely on hold while in service to the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]], devoting themselves solely to their training and their combat missions until their service is complete. For some, this becomes their preferred way of life and they choose to reenlist as soon as their mandatory service is complete; for others, they relish the opportunity to return to civilian life as soon as possible. It is expected (but not enforced) that every [[6. Factions/Suria\|Surian]] who is eligible for the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] completes at least one tour of service in their lifetime. 

[[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] are typically comprised of around 7 individuals each, broken into three infantry lines. In times of active duty these numbers can grow quite dramatically, as they may also travel with other members of the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Eternian Armed Forces\|Eternian Armed Forces]] and/or a few specialized civilian camp followers, such as a priest, engineer, alchemist, musician, or a record-keeper. 

For the most part, the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] recruit exclusively from [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthurian]] citizens-- especially [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]]. It is rare, but not forbidden, for a foreigner to be accepted into the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]], as a [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]]'s trust is not easily won. But for those who are able to make their way into the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]], they will find an exceptionally warm welcome-- as long as they can keep up with the demanding training regimen.  

Most [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] are allocated to static bases with permanent [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Architecture/Castra\|Castra]], or fortresses, that they call home, but in some cases they may effectively disband within a settlement to be levied by their local [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Magistrate\|Magistrate]] as needed. In most cases, [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] are not paid particularly well, and earn far more by looting what they can from the battlefield than they do by staying inside the garrison. For this reason, they tend to have a reputation of being hot-headed and eager to fight, and will often take up side jobs hunting monsters or escorting cargo caravans for some extra coin. 

All [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Solar Legions]] must supply their own weapons and equipment for service. As a result, the different types of units within a [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Solar Legions\|Legion]] tend to break down along social class lines, with the more prestigious assignments and training going to those who can afford it.
