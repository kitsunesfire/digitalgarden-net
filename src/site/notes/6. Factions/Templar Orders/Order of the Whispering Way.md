# Order of the Whispering Way

[[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Raizin\|Raizin]]â€™s [[Templars\|Templars]] are the [[6. Factions/Templar Orders/Order of the Whispering Way\|Order of the Whispering Way]]. The teachings of the Whispering Way are secrets that are not, and cannot, be written down or otherwise recorded. Instead, they can only be passed down from person to person, and achieved through effort and machination. Each Templar holds a piece of the secret, and by networking amongst themselves and sharing their discoveries they gain even greater power. Therefore, this Templar Order is known to be more cooperative than most, and usually work in pairs and teams. The Whispering Way are often dispatched as mediators, negotiators and neutral observers.
