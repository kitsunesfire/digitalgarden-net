The [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] are [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sun\|Sun]]-[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|resonant]] [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] who defend the [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Solar Sanctum\|Solar Sanctum]]. Haughty and arrogant, the [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] generally feel themselves superior to all others-- even the other [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|high elves]]. They are slow to smile, quick to disparage, and always ready to demonstrate their peerless knowledge and skill. Most [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] could be described as conservative, deliberate, and proud, with a reputation for being considerably more religious than most other Zarthurians.

[[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] usually have copper, blond or white hair, and their metallic eyes give an impression of being molten. The [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] are also frequently blessed with pale or golden wings, which they either display proudly or conceal magically as the need arises. 

[[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] value ferocity, vengeance, and devotion above all else. Their long history of brutally exacting revenge for their fallen [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Legionary\|legionnaires ]]and family members have painted them as "radiant [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]]" in the eyes of their neighbors-- especially the [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]], who view them as ruthless and overly rigid. In contrast to this reputation, the [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] boast a vibrant spiritual and compassionate culture that is rarely seen outside of their gilded citadels. 

The [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]] tend to be highly capable fighters, as their society rewards military prowess. As a general rule, they are especially likely to study [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|reiki]], and more often than not possess a natural talent for the divine. The upper ranks of [[6. Factions/Suria\|Surian]] society tend to be made up of generals and priests, and the surest way to improve ones standing is to either impress in the gladiatorial arena of [[4. Gazetteer/Solar Sanctum/Gaelira/Gaelira\|Gaelira]] or to devote oneself to the cloisters of [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Ari Serin/Ari Serin\|Ari Serin]].

Though there are exceptions, [[6. Factions/Suria\|Surians]] are generally far less motivated to become adventurers than most, and tend to prefer to keep to themselves within the confines of their elaborately constructed settlements. After all, their ancient, highly fortified cities are the stuff legends like [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Aten-Ra/Aten-Ra\|Aten-Ra]] are made of, with their tremendous history, beauty and cultural significance spoken of across the realms-- they have little incentive to leave such lavish homes, especially when what surrounds them is the inhospitable hellscape of the [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Red Wastes\|Red Wastes]].
