The [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] are [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Moon\|Moon]]-[[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|resonant]] [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] who defend the [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Lunar Highlands\|Lunar Highlands]]. They are considered by many to be mystical and enigmatic, and are famous for their artistry. Unlike many of their [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] brethren, [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] tend to be quite welcoming to outsiders-- except for the [[6. Factions/Suria\|Suria]], who they typically view as overly rigid, conservative, and cruel. 

[[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] usually have either pallid or olive skin tones and often have rich black hair, but various shades of blue or purple are not uncommon. Their eyes can be any color but are usually very pale, and frequently appear to hold an inner luminescence. 

Of all of the [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]], [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] tend to be the most impulsive, with a strong distaste for complacency or isolation. They are more likely than most to spend at least a portion of their lives on the road, traveling and exploring the untamed wilderness that lay between cities and nations. For this reason, though the [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] hold a large amount of territory within [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], their homeland of the [[4. Gazetteer/Lunar Highlands/Lunar Highlands\|Lunar Highlands]] has relatively few urban centers. Their tendencies towards extroversion and artistry are also part of the reason they frequently find work as merchants, performers, courtesans or diplomats, and often find themselves quite welcome in (most) Zarthurian settlements. 

[[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] are particularly fond of art, and have a strong bardic tradition rooted in a deep history of painting and sculpting. For entertainment, [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] typically like to gamble, taking little risks as part of their fun. Similarly, drinking, seduction and general revelry are important parts of [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amiran]] culture-- perhaps best seen in the [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vesperia/Vespertine Gardens\|Vespertine Gardens]] of [[4. Gazetteer/Vale of Twilight/Vesperia/Vesperia\|Vesperia]]. As such, the [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] have developed a reputation for decadence and hedonistic tendencies, with such a deep love for surrounding themselves with beauty that it generally outweighs any careful consideration to the cost of acquiring it. For instance, the [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] are known to commonly take lovers at their leisure and discard them at their whim-- though they are often able to avoid the consequences of heartbreak by hiding behind a veneer of diplomatic sophistication. 

The [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] are also known for their speed, and when pursued tend to be very difficult to capture. They are well known for their control over shadows, and often possess strange occult powers. [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] are also associated with mind-altering magic and controlling spells, though they would claim that they only use these nightmarish techniques as a last resort when cornered or outnumbered. Some [[6. Factions/Amira\|Amira]] are even said to be able to pass freely between [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]], seemingly emerging from shaded corners and vanishing without a trace. Through their mastery of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Aether/Essences/Polarities/Void\|Void]] magic and strange occult rituals, they are able to thrive where few others would even dare to step, granting them access to the parts of Zarthura's underbelly where the light of day can never be seen.
