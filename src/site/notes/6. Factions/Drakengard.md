A well-connected guild with offices throughout [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], looking to establish a foothold in the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. Best known for ending the [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] blight of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Annihilation\|Age of Annihilation]], stopping Ragnarok, and bringing about the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The Ages/Age of Destiny\|Age of Destiny]]; many watch their moves with at least a passive interest, wondering if they will once again be the catalyst for a world-wide miracle. 

Primarily an adventurers guild based out of Veruna, the [[6. Factions/Drakengard\|Drakengard]] have arrived on Eternian shores at the behest of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Emperor\|Emperor]] (or, more accurately, the [[6. Factions/Eternian Government/Ennead\|Ennead]]), to help train and reinforce the [[6. Factions/Eternian Armed Forces/Imperial Guard\|Imperial Guard]]. In exchange for accepting this contract, the [[6. Factions/Drakengard\|Drakengard]] have been promised the deed to [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Surrse Kasteel/Surrse Kasteel\|Surrse Kasteel]] and granted permission to work on restoring the property to its former glory.
