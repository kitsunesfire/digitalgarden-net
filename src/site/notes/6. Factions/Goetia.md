# Goetia

The [[6. Factions/Goetia\|Goetia]] are powerful [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demon]] lords who rule over [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]]. In [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] very little is known about their actual identities, so they are only referenced by their titles:

- [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The Lord of the Inferno\|The Lord of the Inferno]]
- [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The Morning Star\|The Morning Star]]
- [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The One Without a Master\|The One Without a Master]]
- [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/NPC Compendium/Unmet/The Serpent of the Abyss\|The Serpent of the Abyss]]

Thanks in large part to the protection of [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/The Weave/The Weave\|The Weave]], the [[6. Factions/Goetia\|Goetia]] are too powerful to be able to cross over into [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] in any of the usual ways. However, each of the [[6. Factions/Goetia\|Goetia]] are believed to have a number of subordinate [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demons]] under their control who can act on their behalf and may carry out their will in other realms outside of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]].
