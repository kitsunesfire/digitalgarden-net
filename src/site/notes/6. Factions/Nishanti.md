[[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] are [[5. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] who have a strong [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] with the [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Stars\|Stars]]. The [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] have traditionally been associated with [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarchy]] in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], and as a result, the [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] have historically tended to be the largest faction in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]], with the greatest power and widest influence across the nation. 

However, ever since the catastrophic [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|War of Bleeding Shadows]] (also known as the [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] Civil War), the [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] have fallen on hard times. Having lost control of their ancestral homeland in the [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Diurnan Valley\|Diurnan Valley]]-- as well as a majority of their population-- during [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/The War of Bleeding Shadows\|the war]], what remains of the once-great [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] are now scattered across the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. While not quite a home, there is a notable concentration of [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] that have managed to claim [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Kaer Luthis/Kaer Luthis\|Kaer Luthis]] in the [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Mystic Mire\|Mystic Mire]] and may be looking to use that ancient keep as a base for rebuilding their lost honor and reputation.

[[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] typically have a dark complexion and either white or silver hair. Sometimes, they may have silver or golden freckles or metallic highlights in their hair. They frequently have golden or silver eyes, though some [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] (particularly those who are born under a [[7. Common Knowledge/Weather/Supernatural Phenomena/Blood Moon\|Blood Moon]]) may have red eyes instead. Historically, red eyes were celebrated as a sign of great strength, as many [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] nobles and [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|monarchs]] have had this distinctive feature. However, ever since the long and cruel reign of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Kaiser\|Kaiser]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/Wulfram von Durchenwald\|Wulfram von Durchenwald]], a [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Titles/Monarch/Monarch\|Monarch]], red eyes have been viewed as an ill omen; something to be hidden and feared. 

Due largely to their own propensity for magical and scientific experimentation, [[6. Factions/Nishanti\|Nishanti]] have developed a higher than normal tolerance for most poisons and a resistance to certain magics. In particular, they have been noted to have innate defenses against most sleep poisons, insect venoms, magical methods of hypnosis, and mental control spells.
