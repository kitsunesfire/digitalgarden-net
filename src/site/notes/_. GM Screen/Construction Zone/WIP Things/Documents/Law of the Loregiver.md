# Law of the Loregiver

Also known as "Imperium Domini" (*The Authority of the Gods*), the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]] is a sacred collection of texts believed to be an expression of divine will as expressed by [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]], written by [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/History/Historic Figures/The Loregiver\|The Loregiver]] herself. The [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]] is meant to serve as a guide for mortal behaviors and values so that mortal lives may best align with the will of the gods. 

The [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]] was useful in the early years of the Kingdom of Zarthura in meeting the complex needs of an emergent state that embraced diverse peoples with conflicting interests. The development and interpretation of such rules sought to avert outright chaos, and it became the basis of Zarthurian law. 

From a Zarthurian perspective, these texts describe all of the most aspects of existence, including the basic equilibrium of the universe, the relationship between its constituent parts, the cycle of seasons and heavenly movements, religious observations and good faith, strength and freedom of will, and righteous action. To the ancient Zarthurians, the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]] was proof that all things were bound together in an indestructible unity: the universe, the natural world, the state, and the individual were all seen as parts of the wider world generated by [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Mythos\|Mythos]]. 

One of the most important teachings within the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]] is that every single person has a spark of potentiality-- a spark of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Divinity/Divinity\|Divinity]]-- within them, and that with proper action, reflection, connection, and evolution, this spark can be nurtured into a purifying flame. It is from this basis that the ancient [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Luminari\|Luminari]] took many of their original teachings, and expanded the methods described in the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Things/Documents/Law of the Loregiver\|Law of the Loregiver]] into a practice of self-purification and communion with spirit guides.
