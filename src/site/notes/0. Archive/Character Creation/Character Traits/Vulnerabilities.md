# Vulnerabilities

[[0. Archive/Character Creation/Character Traits/Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerabilities]] describe an important negative element of the character that makes their life more complicated.

Characters select one [[0. Archive/Character Creation/Character Traits/Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerability]] during [[Character Creation\|Character Creation]], and may add more later.
