## Overview
Heartrest has historically been a haven for pirates, mercenaries, soldiers and warriors, and in that regard, little has changed. Home to two of the only [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|Dragon]] known to exist in Sharum Mal’Kari, Heartrest has been at the center of a great deal of political and military strife but somehow has managed to weather every storm.

Many centuries ago, Heartrest was the sole surviving draconic stronghold to withstand the The Great War that obliterated nearly all dragonkind in Sharum Mal’Kari. Then, 100 years ago, during a celebration of that victory, Heartrest once again grabbed global attention as the source of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] that ripped open Juruh Alealam and sent [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] spilling out into Sharum Mal’Kari. For as much as Heartrest has been associated with heroes and champions, it is also synonymous with tragedy and turmoil.

In the past, Heartrest was known for keeping its distance from the world’s political stage and generally refraining from interfering in the matters of other national interests. However, nowadays Lord Alastaer and his Lady Zara have taken a more prominent political role and have been working more openly and collaboratively with their neighbors in the global effort to defeat [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]]. That said, the power couple’s attentions have been diverted as of late with the birth of their first child, Genna.
