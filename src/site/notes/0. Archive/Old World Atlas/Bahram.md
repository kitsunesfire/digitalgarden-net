## Overview
After a [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] fractured the already fragile Bahrami Empire, it collapsed back into the two separate kingdoms that started it all: [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]] and Bahram. Both kingdoms have pushed to return to their historic cultural identities as a form of reinforcing their political division, though they are both still heavily influenced by one another and will never truly return to how they were before. Though the kingdom may no longer be an empire, only a fool would underestimate Bahram’s military might. Bahram has always been associated with un-killable mercenaries and loyal bodyguards, whose leaders have learned much in the art of political dealings over the course of their partnership with the Kingdom of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]]. Whether on foot or on horseback, on the battlefield or in the ballroom, the presence of a Bahrami is almost always an intimidating one.

## Geography
The current territory of the Kingdom of Bahram has very poorly defined borders. Many of the border towns in the northeast are being contested with [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]], most of their western expansion has been lost to either [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithran]] or [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Oyczyzna Podgora]], and most of the rest of their lands have been swallowed up by the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]]. With their former capital in ruins, they are now based out of the Immortal stronghold of Al Basra. 

At the center of Al Basra is Latiadsar, The Temple of Passing. Latiadsar is traditionally where the Rites of the Immortal took place— a ceremony marking a soldier’s acceptance into their ranks. Nowadays, the temple is also home to the royal family and the royal guard. Some believe this is bad luck to house royalty so close to the Atrium of Rebirth.

In the north, one outpost remains open: Nuraldasht. Nestled in Herishan, The Valley of Plenty, it is a dark, rotting, crumbling place that serves to house and resupply the Ash'bahri. Herishan once was the bread basket of the world and Nuraldasht was famous for its stables, but now both have been completely consumed by [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] . When the world thinks of the dangers of dark magic and the horrific consequences of the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]], they think of Herishan. 

In the south, there are small glimpses of the Empire’s former glory, where the [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] has not yet reached. One such place is Miaveh, the Summer Palace. It is a favored place of Bahrami royalty and upper class, and those who have both the means and opportunity will often retreat here for as long as they can to soak up the Mediterranean climate and pretend the rest of the world isn’t on fire.

Though the Empire gave up much when it became a Kingdom once again, it retained one of its greatest achievements: Khorravand, the Great Steelworks. Khorravand is an industrial powerhouse that was once responsible for mass producing armor, armaments, horseshoes and equipment for the vast Immortal ranks as well as the provincial national guards. It has often been said that whoever controls Khorravand holds the potential to mobilize the world into war.  Nowadays, the Great Steelworks has been put to work supporting international efforts that repel [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] and unite humanity, such as producing materials for the Falkan Intercontinental Railway and new [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Czyznic]] roads.

## Appearance
In the Kingdom of Bahram, red is still the color of royalty (as it has always been), though purple has become a less popular choice since the fall of the Empire. Purple used to be the favored color of the Bahrami Empire, signifying the union between the two royal houses, but support for [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]] is now (quietly) indicated with a burgundy hue.

Traditional Bahrami fashion is famous for their sashes, capes, dropped crotch pants and tailored vests. Usually these items would have elaborate embroidery along their hem, though [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] styles have retained popularity and all-over embroidery is still in vogue. Thanks to [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]]s, it is also now more common for Bahrami men to wear fully tailored jackets instead of vests, and for women to wear gowns and high heels. Women still import a great deal of makeup and perfume from [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]], though the current trend has shifted away from purple eyeshadow and more towards bold red lips. Clothing embroidered with spellthread is a sure symbol of status, and anyone wearing a jeweled circlet is guaranteed to be a member of the Bahrami elite.

Bahrami Immortals all wear the same uniforms and the same masks, and for the most part are trained and disciplined to be completely interchangeable.

Most of the world’s cotton and wool come from the Kingdom of Bahram, so most commoners dress in these fabrics. Nobility often prefer silks, tulle or velvet. The symbol of the Bahrami royal house is a golden sun in a deep red sky, so gold accents are particularly popular and often associated with nobility. Occasionally they get mistaken for the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] starburst...and are quite sensitive about it.

## Military & Diplomacy
The most well-known Bahrami military force is their Immortals, a world-class strike force capable of toppling nations and tearing down regimes. To become an Immortal is the highest honor a Bahrami commoner can hope to achieve. Some Bahrami nobility also enter the Immortal ranks, though it is more common for royalty to command rather than serve; it can be seen as a step down for a prince to become a nameless, faceless Immortal for the same reason it is usually seen as a step up for a commoner.

The Kingdom of Bahram has also long since been associated with horseback riding, and some of the best war horses in the world have been bred in Bahrami stables. While [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtan]] horses are known for their speed, Bahrami horses tend to be bulky, stubborn and resilient, able to take the full force of an attack and keep pushing on. Some say that the Kingdom’s horses are as just as un-killable as their famed Immortals, and perhaps are also subject to [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] rituals to help them cheat death. 

The transformation of Khorravand from a symbol of war to that of peace and prosperity is indicative of a deeper cultural change that is happening in Bahram; most of the public is incredibly proud, but there are those who see Khorravand as evidence that the lions of Bahram have become “kittens mewling at the world’s lap” and call for their Shahan to show his teeth. They blame [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]] for making Bahrami bloodlines weak, and they blame [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Heartrest\|Heartrest]] for causing the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] that ripped their country apart.

The fact that the current Shahan comes from a mixed [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] family is not officially a problem, but any time anything unpopular is decided or anything goes wrong it is said that it is due to his [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] linage. Ever since the Shahan’s confirmation there have been small pockets of rebellion (especially in the capital) that have pushed for Nasim to be replaced by a “true” Bahrami. These rebels are fond of saying that “The sun has not yet set on the Bahrami Empire”, but so far these rebels have turned out to be all talk and no action. It is very likely that the constant threat of [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] is all that is keeping this kingdom from civil war.

## Magic & Faith
Immortals and members of the Bahrami royal family are known to practice [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] as part of their tradition, and as a result a majority of their once-noble ranks have fallen to [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]]. You would be hard pressed to find a Bahrami who hasn’t known a loved one who has become corrupted, so they tend to be sympathetic... but cautious. 

## Education & Technology
The best chance at receiving an education in the Kingdom of Bahram is through joining the Immortals. Outside of the Immortals, those who show true academic promise are sent abroad for their education, since most of the Bahrami public schools have either fallen to ruin or been converted to other purposes. While education has always been important to the Bahrami people, not everyone can afford the luxury since the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]]; there are more poor and illiterate Bahrami now than there ever have been in the Kingdom’s history. It is a source of great shame, and something that Shahan Nasim Tajik is working tirelessly to correct. Some of his critics have complained that this is a misuse of kingdom funding and that he needs to focus more on purchasing urban defenses and reinforcements so that they can better hold their crumbling territory. 

## Family Life
Arranged marriages are quite common in Bahrami culture, and there is often a great deal of pressure to produce a large family in order to increase the chances of one’s bloodline surviving the ravaging [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]] . Even before the [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]], large families were the Bahrami norm; a typical household would have had four or five children. It is culturally expected that the children grow up to then take care of their parents and older relatives, and that their achievements are often seen as an extension of their parents’ success. 

## Naming Conventions
Bahrami names are inspired by Persian/Iranian names. Traditionally, the mother has the honor of naming their children while the father’s last name is carried from generation to generation. What follows are some examples of traditional Bahrami names:

Personal names: Siavash, Javad, Rasoul, Milad, Fazel, Kannan, Amin, Akram, Nikou, Hanieh, Touran, Ziba, Mahdi, Sohrab 

Family names: Tabasi, Azari, Mousavi, Shariati, Fardin, Meskini, Mehrnia, Chavoshi, Golchin, Salehi, Bayat

After many generations of arranged marriages between Bahrami and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] families, it is also extremely common (especially amongst nobility) to have names that are a cultural hybrid between the two.
