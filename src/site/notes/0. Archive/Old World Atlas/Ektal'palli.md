## Overview
There are few places in the world that are as isolated and reclusive as Ektal’palli. A nation entirely populated by dozens of varieties of tengu, they are not known to take kindly to wingless folk and are extremely protective of their territory. The tengu build their nests high up in the cliffs of the scattered islands of Ektal’palli, and tend to live in close-knit community clusters. It is unusual, but not unheard of, for a tengu to leave these communities and travel to the mainland— but those that do are seldom granted permission to return.

In ancient times, it used to be common practice to hunt tengu. In some primeval texts there are references to great hunters who would mount tengu wings as trophies, or line their cloaks with their delicate feathers. Though these practices are no longer commonplace, the tengu have not forgiven or forgotten their treatment at the hands of humans, and have been known to imprison and torture trespassers in retaliation.
