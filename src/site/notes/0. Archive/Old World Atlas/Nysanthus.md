## Overview
Nysanthus is a nation that largely follows its own rules. They have a reputation for being slippery, shifty, and not to be trusted, which has been earned over centuries of hard-fought independence and outwitting would-be invaders. Nysanthans have made the most of their humid, marshy surroundings and are some of the world’s leading experts in fishing and crabbing. Their mineral-rich soil and water are also key ingredients for most high-end spa treatments, and the ruined structures that lurk beneath the murky surface are filled with untold wonders... and gold. *Lots of gold*. Some ruin divers have even been able to find ancient adamantium coins, which are regularly collected and smelted down into bars by Nysanthan master smiths.

## Geography
Nysanthus is a salt marsh that occupies most of the south-eastern corner of the continent. It is characterized by murky salt water, thick humid air and frequent rainstorms. In the central and eastern-most parts of Nysanthus, mangroves dominate the landscape and make travel extremely difficult.

In the north-west there are wide expanses of waterfalls collectively referred to as the Dakryasoli. As the only consistent source of fresh water in Nysanthus, it is revered as a holy font of life and many Nysanthans make annual pilgrimages to receive blessings for their tribe. Nysanthan water and mud from these holy sites are often sold as luxury items (and are often counterfeited). The nearby city of Chrysapas is a popular tourist destination for their spiritual spa treatments.

## Appearance
Since many Nysanthans are either [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Nagaji\|Nagaji]], [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]], or [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Lizardfolk\|Lizardfolk]], the embellishment of scales has an important place in Nysanthan fashion. Nysanthans are also particularly known for their affinity for piercings and body painting. In the tribal lands, these embellishments usually have deep symbolic meaning, but in the cities it is more likely to be done for purely aesthetic reasons. [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]] sometimes undergo body modification to close the fork in their tongue; likewise, non-viskanyans sometimes split their tongues to appear more like a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]].

[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Nagaji\|Nagaji]] tend to make up some of the most capable warriors in Nysanthus, who place honor, devotion and dedication above all else. Strong of body and personality, they tend to display talents for both swords and sorcery and usually work as monster hunters and bodyguards for the elite.

[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]] are particularly well-known for their spell casting capabilities and often find work as mystics, fortune tellers and entertainers. They are said to have poisonous blood and hypnotizing beauty, and are generally characterized as deceptive and seductive beings that speak through forked tongues— both literally and metaphorically.

Largely due to their scaled skin, Nysanthans are not always seen as “humanoid” and have historically been hunted for their skin. While this practice is illegal, some particularly desperate hunters still make a living off of it.

## Military & Diplomacy
Nysanthans don’t have much of a history with engaging in foreign affairs. Generally speaking, they don’t think very much of the “soft” Mal’Karians and see them as gullible, easy targets. The rest of the world has often mistakenly called Nysanthans “half-formed dragonkin”, which Nysanthans see as proof of Mal’Karian stupidity and justification for taking advantage of them.

## Magic & Faith
Nysanthans place little emphasis on the pursuit of magical or religious education, though they are a spiritual people. 

## Education & Technology
Nysanthan education is mostly in the form of apprenticeships. Most Nysanthans begin apprenticeships at a young age, and are expected to try many different things. When it becomes clear to the mentor that the student has a knack for that work or trade, they are offered a job title and then usually will remain in that job until they become an elder. If a Nysanthan reaches adulthood without choosing a job or having a job title offered to them, they simply become a general gatherer and mender for the tribe and assist their neighbors in whatever odd jobs need doing. Those that do this job well are highly respected; those that neglect this duty are shamed and eventually banished.

## Family Life
Nysanthans follow a strict social hierarchy in which individuals are identified as nobles, commoners, serfs, or slaves. The noble class consists of government and military leaders, high level priests, and lords. Priests have their own internal class system and are generally expected to be celibate and refrain from alcohol. Nobles are typically entitled to receive tribute from the commoners in the form of goods, services, and labor. Noble status may be passed on through both male and female lineages, and only nobles are permitted to display their wealth by wearing capes decorated with gold and other gold jewelry.

Commoners generally reside in “calpolli”, or neighborhoods, that are lead by a single nobleman or a council of elders. Serfs work on land that is owned by nobles and do not live in the calpolli. Individuals may become a slave as a form of punishment for certain crimes of for failure to pay tribute. An individual can voluntarily sell themselves or their children into slavery to pay back a debt. Slaves have the right to marry, to have children, to substitute another in their place, and to buy back their freedom. Nysanthans cannot be born slaves and cannot inherit this status from their parents. Prisoners who did not become slaves may sometimes be used as sacrifices.

## Naming Conventions
Nysanthan names are inspired by Greek and Hellenic names, and commonly emphasize the “s” sound. A Nysanthan’s name is extremely important to them; it is a symbol of belonging and worn like a badge of honor throughout their life. The worst dishonor a Nysanthan can experience is having their name taken away.

Some examples include: Fanis, Zaharias, Alkiviadis, Dorotheos, Lazaros, Orestis, Claude, Claus, Dionysios, Gianni, Christoforos, Ignatios, Tolas, Valentinos, Photios, Ismini, Danai, Spiridos, Hikesias, Anakreon, Nikandros, Kebes, Menippos, Obelos, Neseas, Sthena, Lysippe.

Most urban Nysanthans are [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Human\|Human]] or [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Beastkin/Vishkanya\|Vishkanya]]. They typically form familial units rather than the sprawling tribes of the lizardfolk, and therefore take on family names. Some popular urban family names are: Thaniadis, Vallelis, Nassilis, Markoulis, Sarantoulis, and Constantinouli.
