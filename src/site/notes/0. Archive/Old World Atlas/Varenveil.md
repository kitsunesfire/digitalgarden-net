## Overview
Varenveilians are people who, at their core, believe in hospitality and kindness to strangers, and take a great deal of offense to those who would do wrong to a helpless soul. They are very spiritual and have many rituals that are viewed as occult, strange and at times even frightening by the rest of the world, but that doesn’t stop them from doing what they feel is right. A peaceful people, they are slow to anger but incredibly dangerous when provoked, much like the wild creatures they worship and live alongside. That said, it has been a very long time since anyone has witnessed a Varenveilian rage firsthand; the people of the Burning Sky have a tendency to keep to themselves and out of foreign affairs, so much of what is known about them can be dismissed as exaggerated rumor and mythos.

## Geography
Varenveil is almost entirely made up of tundra, taiga, ice floes and frozen wilderness. In an average year, they might experience some form of snowfall nine months out of the year, with the other three barely reaching a thaw. The winter winds are famous here, and likely to blow inexperienced hikers off of mountainsides and cliffs, so elaborate climbing gear is essential for anyone choosing to venture off the beaten path...of which there are few. Varenveil isn’t exactly known for roadways, often preferring to follow the tracks of whatever came before them or using the stars to plot their own course.

Under the thick, perpetual layer of snow, everything starts to look the same to the untrained eye. Even landmarks are hard to make out in Varenveil, as the terrain is frequently shifting, melting, and re-freezing in new ways. Amidst all of this blank white sameness, there are three natural phenomena that are immediately recognizable and largely unchanging.

Firstly, and most famously, there is the Burning Sky— a brilliant blaze of color that periodically lights up the night sky. There are many conflicting opinions as to what it is, exactly, that causes the Burning Sky (and consequently, what it might mean), but all can agree that it is a beautiful sight to behold.

Secondly, there is Lake Ourense. This great lake is usually completely frozen over, but for a few months out of the year it thaws and allows for skilled fishermen to try their hand at catching the rare, exquisite creatures that lurk within. There are many folk tales about Lake Ourense, including accounts of giant sea serpents or frozen titans that got trapped somewhere deep within. Others say that merfolk may dwell hidden in the ice, and others still say that there are ruins of ancient civilizations lost down below. Whatever the truth, Lake Ourense provides a great deal of entertainment and sustenance for local Varenveilians.

Finally, there is Mount Muros. Mount Muros is a long-dormant volcano that looks over the capital, protecting it from the sharpest of winds and storms. Mount Muros is extraordinarily difficult to climb, given the temperature, altitude and weather conditions, but many believe that an ancient druid circle has made a home up there, serving as guardians for the rest of Varenveil, rumored to possess the powers to manipulate the weather and seasons.

## Appearance
Varenveilians wear thick furs, leathers, and animal skins, usually in layers. They pay a lot to import waterproof canvas; it usually ends up in the hands of the shamans and hunters.  Their fashion sense is largely their own and has experienced little influence from foreign cultures. Varenveilians seldom waste animal parts from those they have hunted, and are more likely than most to wear animal bones, feathers, furs or teeth as decorative elements in their outfits. They commonly use decorative paints, tattoos or piercings in spiritual expression, and often wear beads or feathers in their hair.

## Military & Diplomacy
Varenveilians are rather removed from global politics and position themselves as close to neutral as possible in any conflict. Historically they have been allied with both [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Heartrest\|Heartrest]] and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]], and are generally sympathetic to their causes, but have never provided troops or financial aid for any war efforts. This is especially true of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]], whom they were once a part of but have been independent from for centuries now.

They are on peaceful terms with [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Falkor\|Falkor]] and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Oyczyzna Podgora]], both of whom are significant trading partners for Varenveil, and have little interaction with any nation further south than that. If Varenveil has ever been involved in military conflict (or, for that matter, even has an actual army to put to such a use), nobody can say; their strong alliances and relatively meager natural resources have prevented them from ever becoming a major target. However, it has been rumored that [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]] may one day wish to reclaim Varenveil and absorb their northern lands back into the kingdom.

## Magic & Faith
Varenveil recognizes the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]], especially [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ziyad\|Ziyad]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Harun\|Harun]], and often work their iconography into their personal style. They believe that the phenomenon of the Burning Sky is a sign from [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Harun\|Harun]] that marks his journey into the heavens and is a time where spirits of the departed can be communicated with more easily. It is a common time for funerial rites, vigils, seances and similar ceremonies, as well as a popular time to set out on important journeys or pilgrimages.

They also actively seek to honor the spirits of the departed, and wish to help their passing into the afterlife. It is common for widows and widowers to travel to Varenveil in hopes of meeting with a shaman to help their dearly departed pass on peacefully, especially during the Burning Sky. They have a close relationship with nature and wildlife, and consider their village’s hunters to be amongst their most sacred and honored members. Their practice of making use of every scrap of a hunted creature has led to the belief that Varenveilian shamans use [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] and ritualistic sacrifice, and their use of animal bones and skulls in their fashion and decoration has often been a cause of concern.

A large percentage of the world’s druids come from Varenveil, and for good reason— there is something about the climate here that seems to lend itself to particularly potent primal magic, leading many scholars to believe that there is a large, powerful nexus somewhere underneath the ice shelf— most likely either under Lake Ourense or atop Mount Muros.

## Education & Technology
Traditional Varenveilian education emphasizes learning by application and imitation, not by memorization and basic information. It also emphasizes learning by sharing and cooperation, as compared with [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] education that emphasizes competition and individualism. Varenveilian oral histories tell and re-tell local origin myths and how they have spurred people to great deeds, and strive to enforce a sense of “proper” etiquette, where the children have an abiding respect for their elders and never turn away a person in need. Most Varenveilians go through the education system, even those who immigrate to Varenveil as adults, as they believe it is an important part of being truly Varenveilian.

Varenveilian technological advancement isn’t well known in the world, but is mostly associated with tools and leatherwork. Varenveilians produce the best climbing equipment and snowshoes in the world, and are the most reliable when it comes to weather-proof caravans and sleighs.

## Family Life
As a general rule, anyone willing to assimilate into Varenveilian culture and adopt their traditions is welcome in their society, no matter where they came from or what their life has been before. That said, a life in the frozen north is a difficult one and rarely a person’s first choice, so immigrants tend to be the wild and desperate outcasts of other civilizations.

Varenveilian homes are punctuated by the smell of a fire first and foremost. To a Veilian, a home without a fire is a home without a soul, and all should be welcomed by its hearth. Veilians are deeply rooted in an unspoken social contract, where nearly all are to be welcomed inside of one’s home. In exchange, the guest is expected to help around the homestead (despite their host’s protests). This is exemplified in the traditional stews of Varenveil, some of which have been said to have been cooking for years. Every guest adds something new to the pot and each stew becomes a unique blend of all who travel through.

In general, Varenveilian families tend to be quite large and not necessarily defined by blood relation; fostering and adoption are both common, and it is very normal to live with a “chosen” family in the same way one might live with a nuclear family elsewhere in Sharum Mal’Kari.

## Naming Conventions
In Varenveil, outsiders are expected to adopt Varenveilian names if they wish to relocate permanently. Even frequent visitors, such as merchants, diplomats or students, will usually have a Varenveilian name they use while they are in Varenveil. In Varenveil, it is customary for children to take their mother’s last name, and most heterosexual married couples use their wife’s name for formal affairs and documentation. Varenveilian names are inspired by Galician names. Some common examples have been provided below:

Personal Names: Cristobo, Zabier, Iago, Roi, Moreno, Ventura, Sabino, Humberto, Anastasio, Sibilina, Edelmira, Caridade, Noela, Merces, Carmela, Alma, Micael, Mateu, Roberto, Minia, Elisabet, Leda, Berta, Dores, Iria, Baltasara, Madalena, Odelia

Family Names: Canton, Fragoso, Nogueira, Savaria, Lence, Ravelo, Barela, Balboa, Aponte, Marin, Acuna, Raya, Padron, Lema, Caamano, Mella, Solar, Rodis, Marcelin, Davila, Botello, Barra, Lugo
