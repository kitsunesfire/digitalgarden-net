## Overview
Though the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Johtaja\|Johtaja]] is universally recognized as a wild and dangerous place, deep in the waters off the coast of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]] lies an island where true chaos reigns. Camboragh is a seedy den of pirates, thieves, and others who would rather their true identities and intentions remain a mystery.

While not completely inhospitable, the purpose of this island is not to make a home. Build into a long-abandoned, centuries-old fortress, the majority of the island functions as a no-holds-barred, anything-goes coliseum. The few who call this place home usually live in the damp slums or on a ship pulled to port. The rest are either prisoners, locked in watery cages until their number is called for an event, or spectators, ferried in on small ships mostly from [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Gath\|Gath]] and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Nysanthus\|Nysanthus]]. The participants in these arena events are housed in the sprawling catacombs in the underbelly of the island, with the top prize fighters treated as guests of honor in the Chairmen’s Residence.

In addition to the coliseum, Camboragh has a robust black market that trades in all manner of goods and services; typically things that cannot be found or asked for anywhere else in the world may be requested here...at your own risk. It is one of the only places in the world where the Shiverblade Nigh are known to openly operate, and representatives and fences for a wide variety of other dangerous and illegal services are readily available. In many ways, Camboragh is to illegal activity what Veruna is to guilds— just far less regulated, and with zero public security.
