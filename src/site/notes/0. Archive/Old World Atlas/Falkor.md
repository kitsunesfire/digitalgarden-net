## Overview
Falkor is nothing if not a land of extreme contrast. Traditionally, Falkor has been home to tribes of druids, rangers, sorcerers and shamans that have specialized in alchemy and elemental magic. Wild magic has always run rampant here, which some attribute to the perpetual volcanic activity. While the ancient ways still have their place in Falkan society, Falkor is also the birthplace of the world’s latest (and greatest) technological revolution, which has put the urban ruling class at odds with their rural counterparts. The first to sail the skies (and the first to fall out of them!), Falkor is known for their bravery, creativity, ingenuity and complete lack of patience. Come for the modern marvels, stay for the thermal baths and futuristic splendor...but take care before stepping into or onto anything Falkan-made—it will very likely be the ride of your life.

## Geography
Falkor is famous for their unique geography, which attracts tourists from all over the world all year long. Unlike the ski chalets of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Varenveil\|Varenveil]], Falkor’s frigid landscape is punctuated by active volcanoes, black sand beaches, and deep natural hot springs which seem to overflow with natural magical properties. This geothermal activity is the secret to Falkor’s early breakthroughs in steam technology, and their volcanic forges have produced some truly unique and innovative weaponry. 

Most folk outside of Falkor will know it for Sólstaðir, the luxurious hot spring resort town nestled into the northern coast. Quiet, calm and peaceful, Sólstaðir is inaccessible except by Falkor’s local train. When you’re here, it’s easy to feel safe and separate from the rest of the world. If the advertising is true, the waters here have natural healing qualities that can soothe all but the most extreme of aches and pains. Some say that the spa attendants are [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Ihtar\|Ihtari]] healers in training— but since they are typically instructed not to speak and to only use Falkan Sign Language, few know for sure. 

Further south, near the center of the region, is the massive volcanic forge known as Varmahlavik. Though Falkor owns and operates many similar forges, Varmahlavik is by far the largest and well known. The workshop attached to this forge is where the majority of Falkan airships and steam trains are assembled, and most of the capital’s construction needs are met through their tireless work.

Hverafirði, occasionally shortened to “Hvera” by outsiders, is a fairly large border town in the south-west of Falkor. It is the largest airship  station and one of the busiest train or caravan stations in the world (so far). It is in Hverafirði that most outsiders first experience the wonders of Falkan steam technology, in all of its impressive, magnificent (and occasionally broken) glory. Hverafirði is also home to the world’s first fully functional automatic clock tower, which was only just unveiled earlier this year. A modern marvel, tourists and locals alike look up towards it with awe and wonder what else Falkor will think of next.

## Appearance
All Falkans have at least one pair of goggles, usually to protect their eyes from volcanic ash (but also as a fashion statement). Falkor is associated with steampunk fashion, and their experimentation with technology is certainly reflected in their streetwear. Falkor is considered to be the go-to destination for avant garde fashion.

Falkor’s long-standing friendship with the cities of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]] has also worked its way into their preferred style of dress. Falkans frequently import corsetry from [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]] and embellish them with additional buckles, lacework, grommets, or buttons. [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Veretian]] embroidery also often makes its way here, though these fabrics are more often used for decoration than for dressing— which has resulted in more than a few unpleasant misunderstandings.

## Military & Diplomacy
Though Falkor produces a large volume of new inventions for the Mal’Karian markets, most reputable merchants aren’t willing to carry them for fear of malfunction. This is where Falkor’s alliance with [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Vere\|Vere]]— more specifically, the city of Veruna— has proven most strategic. Verunan merchants have a reputation for having the absolute highest standards in all the lands, especially when it comes to foreign-made goods. By getting their wares sold through a Verunan merchant, Falkans can easily expect to charge twice as much as they would be able to charge if they were selling on their own name. As much as Falkan leadership has been networking and building new alliances, their partnership with Veruna will always be a special relationship. However, if the rumors are true, it seems that Chairman Fornason has been pushing merchants to shop around other deals to get around the high Verunan taxes and begin selling their products more directly, now that they have become more popular. Time will tell if these rumors have any teeth, or how Veruna may react to such a betrayal…

In terms of technology level and available production, Falkor undoubtedly has the greatest military capacity in the modern world. However, this potential has not yet been fully realized due to a lack of manpower; while Falkor consistently receives tourists, they have a much harder time keeping local talent. The geography of Falkor can be harsh and unwelcoming, especially when [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Rioja\|Riojan]] beaches are calling and urging Falkan engineers to their shores. Many of their best creative minds have been recruited for foreign posts and engineering projects, and even in cases where the assignment is temporary they often choose to stay abroad rather than return to Falkor.

## Magic & Faith
Folklore and folk tales have always been an important part of traditional Falkan culture. Outside the mechanical buzz of the cities, there are still some traditional settlements which honor the old druidic ways and may prefer to worship the [[_. GM Screen/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|The Primordial Spirits]] or the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Archomentals/The Archomentals\|The Archomentals]] .

In the urban centers, very little magic is practiced. If anything, some folk may still practice divine magic — especially the worship of the Maker, [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]], and the Journeyman, [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Harun\|Harun]]— but these are the old ways, from before the Revolution, and most of the common folk feel little need to practice such ceremony. In the old days, the [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Foreign Pantheons/The Old Gods\|The Old Gods]] were credited with providing creativity, innovation and salvation to all Falkans; it was commonly said that pursuit of the divine lifts one up and gives a Falkan their wings. However, the events of the Revolution served as a reminder that all magic always has a cost, and sharply turned most away from trusting divine magic (or any magic, for that matter). Instead the Falkan people now put their faith in innovations of science— which, for all intents and purposes, they treat as magic in its own right. 

The traditional settlements in Falkor are quick to point out that science also comes at a price, but their complaints more often than not fall on deaf ears. 

## Education & Technology
Falkans are exceptionally creative, but typically produce poor quality work that is extremely inconsistent. They are synonymous with industrial revolution and innovation. Falkor is currently the only place in the world that produces airships, heavy artillery, firearms and steam trains, though all of these products are being exported to some degree to the rest of the continent.

About 50 years ago, a magical mishap resulted in a massive volcanic explosion that nearly destroyed the capital. The details surrounding the source of the calamity vary greatly between accounts, and it’s very likely that the truth of the matter is either buried deep in ash or encased in the magma heart of the volcano itself. The accepted narrative claims that there was a mad mage named Eliza Hermann whose attempts to appeal to the spirit of the volcano were entirely too successful, awakening a power she could not hope to control. The Hermann Research Center, named after her, was abandoned for many years but is now run by her nephew in an attempt to rehabilitate her reputation. 

After the explosion, Falkans rebuilt their society with the intention to find non-magical solutions to their needs and invested heavily in steam power. This industrious focus kicked off the Falkan Revolution, wherein Falkor became a technocracy, appointed a new Chairman, and enjoyed a newfound power on the world stage. 

Most Falkans place little trust in the ways of magic and much prefer scientific solutions to their problems. Though Falkan technology has a reputation for breaking, they take comfort in the idea that they know how to fix it and have the tools to do so—unlike with magic, which when wild and broken cannot be stopped. Falkans value practical, technical education and usually encourage their youth to become apprentices at an early age and to explore many different mechanical disciplines. While not explicitly forbidden, the study of magic within Falkor is rare and socially discouraged. 

Traditionally, Falkor has also excelled in the study of alchemy. This has become especially popular since the Falkan Revolution, with common folk seeking out natural, non-magical remedies for what ails them. 

## Family Life
A Falkan is expected to live with their nuclear family until they marry, at which point they are expected to live with their spouse. It is highly unusual for a Falkan to live alone— especially voluntarily.
