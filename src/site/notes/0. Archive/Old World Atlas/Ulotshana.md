## Overview
Not so much a place as a phenomenon, the Ulotshana is the name given to the supernatural effects that occur underneath a particular constellation of a fox. Unlike other constellations, this one does not have a fixed position in the night sky, and while it has a few “preferred” locations that it tends to appear more often than others, it is fickle and unpredictable. Many scholars have theorized that the Ulotshana signals an opening into [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]], which accounts for the wide spectrum of supernatural effects that happen in its influence. Some common signs of the Ulotshana’s influence include glowing water, multi-colored wildlife, unexpected pockets of fog or mist, high concentrations of fireflies, ghostly creatures, whispering voices without an obvious source, unnatural movement of trees and plant life, and other auditory and visual hallucinations. It is extremely common for travelers to get lost when caught up in the Ulotshana. At once mystical and frightening, the Ulotshana is the stuff of beautiful nightmares and haunting fairytales.

Those who have studied the Ulotshana attribute its presence to Kiriani. Some call him nothing more than a trickster, using the Ulotshana to confuse, scare and amaze his audience for his own amusement. Others see him as something more sinister, using the Ulotshana for some as-of-yet undefined greater purpose in the pursuit of power. The extent of his powers are also a matter of great debate, with some researchers insisting that he is powerful enough to make himself into the constellation and that is why it moves, while others believe that he has the power to draw starts towards him and that it wanders as he wanders, forever chasing its master. Not all grant him such great power or control, and instead believe that the Ulotshana is a mostly natural phenomenon that has been embellished greatly by bards and storytellers who wish to make it out to be a far grander spectacle than it truly is.
