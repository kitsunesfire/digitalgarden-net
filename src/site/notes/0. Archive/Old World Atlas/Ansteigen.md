## Overview

The island of Ansteigen is best characterized as dangerous and foreboding, with untold and unspeakable horrors creeping through the perpetual mist and haunting every corner. Ansteigen is a place where magic is known to go wild and behave erratically, occasionally creating eldritch abominations and dangerous mutations that don’t seem to happen anywhere else. Of course, new threats must be met with new challengers— and so, Ansteigen has become home to a new, strange and fearsome class of monster hunters known as [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]]. Often viewed as abominations themselves, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] are a rarely welcome but often necessary defensive measure employed by city guards and townsfolk who can afford them. Those that cannot must learn to make do with they have, often brewing strange alchemical concoctions to give themselves an edge. 

## Geography

Most of the land in Ansteigen is damp and uninviting. Between the long winters and the massive wetlands, it is difficult to grow crops or tend to animals; the average citizen of Ansteigen is no stranger to hunger or thirst. Still, the hearty people of this land have found a silver lining of opportunity amidst these harsh conditions, for they have discovered a wide variety of strange and unusual flora and fauna that thrive where “normal” creatures cannot. As a result, Ansteigen has become home to all manner of exotic meats and produce.

Still, these pockets of almost-civilization are few and far between in Ansteigen. Steigenite cities have mostly been built up into the highlands, with some settlements brave enough to build directly on top of ancient ruins. For the most part, however, Steigenites know better than to disturb these ancient sites, for they are associated with dark magic and nightmarish horrors. It is believed that unspeakably powerful secrets are trapped inside these tombs of knowledge, but all who dare to venture into the depths either perish...or return mad, deranged, and unrecognizable. Only the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] have had any degree of success in routing these sites, and even they have difficulty surviving the special brand of darkness that thrives down there…

The prime exception to this rule has been the Versunhans Tempel, under Auerbruck. Its partially submerged entrance still makes it a challenge to get inside, but [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] and local scouts alike have been using this temple as a starting point for expeditions and exploration for years now, as it seems to be connected to other underground sites of magical interest. 

In the Steigenite lowlands there’s Lake Rachen, famous for it’s seemingly endless depths. More a sinkhole than a lake, locals often refer to it as Schwarzenlich, or “the Black Hole”. Many folk tales say that the Schwarzenlich is sentient and hungers for human blood— especially that of children and virgins. Most of these stories are used to scare children into being obedient, but some more superstitious Steigenites caution against dismissing them entirely.

## Appearance

Steigenites dress as warmly as they are able, given their circumstances. It is difficult to get properly waterproofed canvas or leather; those that have such items treasure them as worth their weight in gold, and often pass them on to their children as prized heirlooms. Due to the persistent [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]], it is very unusual for a Steigenite to wear plate armor; it rusts far too quickly to be worth the cost, and tends to keep the moisture in, not out. Instead, Steigenite warriors of all classes and traditions tend to prefer studded leather armor and waxed cotton jackets.

Most Steigenites have dark, curly hair and dark eyes. The most common exception to that rule are the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]], which are easily distinguished from the rest by their pale, silvery eyes and/or grey hair. Some Hexerei have hair so pale they get mistaken for [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthurian]], which has added to the popularity of the myth that white haired folk are mutated or cursed. A [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]]’s silver eyes are said to also be the result of mutation, designed to enhance one’s vision and allow them to see what can’t be seen. Old folk tales say that part of the ritual to become a [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] involves willingly submitting oneself to spectral possession, which might be part of what causes their unnaturally pale features and grants them supernatural abilities. Some even go so far as to call them Geistermänner, or “Ghost Men”. 

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] are unable to bear children, so it is unknown what effect (if any) their mutations might have on children. In extremely rare circumstances, some Steigenite villages have noted children being born with pale [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] eyes; these children are usually either forcibly blinded, abandoned or sacrificed to the Schwarzenlich, depending on the particular superstitions of the village in question. Such cursed children are a shameful secret and rarely acknowledged or discussed.

## Military & Diplomacy

Modern Ansteigen is far more concerned with domestic affairs than they are with international ones, but external records suggest that this was not always the case. In fact, according to neighboring nations, Ansteigen used to be well-known and feared as a global superpower and a massively dominating military threat. This reputation comes as something of a surprise to modern Steigenite monarchy, who have no recollection of such military campaigns or conquests and no evidence to prove they were ever involved in such activities. Internationally, this has lead to the reputation that Steigenites have faulty memories and may be at least a little bit insane. Maybe it has something to do with the [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Miasma\|Miasma]] they’re constantly breathing in?

Just because they can’t remember the source of their disagreements doesn’t mean that Ansteigen’s rivalries have dissipated to any meaningful degree. Relations with the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/United Altos Isles\|United Altos Isles]] are still as tense as they have ever been (almost out of tradition and spite), and the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Cheongai\|Cheongai]] still looks to them with suspicion and distrust. Ansteigen generally doesn’t question these misgivings, for they often feel the same way about themselves. 

## Magic & Faith

For as long as anyone can remember, Ansteigen has been referred to as a godless land. Whether as a result of some forgotten punishment for a forgotten crime, or as a natural consequence of neglecting prayer and worship, it seems that the common folk of Ansteigen are wholly unable to benefit from the effects of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|Reiki]]. Even foreign clerics have reported difficulties performing their duties here, lending credence to the theory that Ansteigen is well and truly cursed. Ansteigen is notable as one of the only places in the world that does not have restrictions on the study of magic. They do not use or require casting licenses, and have very little in the way of magical policing. This is largely due to the lethality of daily life in Ansteigen; people here are eager to find and use any tool that may help them survive these horrors, no matter what the rest of the world may think about its ethics or legality. This “no holds barred” approach has lead to some tremendous experimentation and innovation that would otherwise be impossible, and has drawn some of the more eccentric magical and mystical minds to attempt to set up laboratories in Ansteigen. 

Due to its geography, occultism is the most popular field of study in Ansteigen, with the studies of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] and alchemy close behind. It is believed that otherwise illegal advancements in the practices of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Hematomancy\|Hematomancy]] and experimental alchemy are what gave rise to the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Hexerei\|Hexerei]] and their unusual abilities— for better, and for worse. 

## Education & Technology

Education is fairly limited in Ansteigen. Books don’t tend to do well in the damp climate, and most of their own local records were lost long ago. There are some small schoolhouses that instruct mostly through folk tales and oral histories; it is perfectly normal in Ansteigen to reach adulthood without having ever read a single book or scroll. 

Most of the technological advancement in Ansteigen has been centered around defending oneself against dark arts and adapting other existing technologies for use in this strange environment— for instance, developing special nets that can catch spirits, or traps that blighted rats can’t simply chew their way out of. 

## Family Life

Steigenite families are generally quite small, with newborn children prized and protected above all else. There are commonly-held beliefs that deceased children come back as spirits to haunt their communities, sometimes dragging others into their graves with them. Out of this fear, the people of Ansteigen regularly prioritize childcare over nearly all else. 

## Naming Conventions

Steigenite names are inspired by German names. More than most other regions, it is extremely unusual for someone from Ansteigen to have a foreign name;  Ansteigen does not have a lot of immigration-- and those that do come to Ansteigen are usually adventurers or treasure seekers, not people who settle and stay. The only exception to this rule may be certain scholars, scientists or researches who may have relocated to pursue their studies. Some common examples of Steigenite names have been provided below:

Personal Names: Dennis, Kajetan, Rupert, Hugo, Lars, Harald, Manfred, Theodor, Ralf, Antonia, Denise, Serafina, Hanne, Klara, Cecilia, Gesine, Madlen, Larissa, Claus, Aayden, Caspar, Emil, Noah, Holder, Eric, Roland, Rachel, Karla, Fiona, Natali
