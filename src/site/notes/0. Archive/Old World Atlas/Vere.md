## Overview
The Kingdom of Vere is at once one of the newest and oldest kingdoms in Sharum Mal’Kari. Though their kings can trace their lineage back to the dawn of civilization, it was only in the past 100 years that Vere regained their independence from the former [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire. In that time, Veretians have done much to set themselves apart from their [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] counterparts and reclaim their national identity. Mostly this has meant a return to tradition— to a time before [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]], before [[6. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|Dragon]], before foreign rule of any sort.

The greatest success of modern Vere has been in establishing an international guild system. This new way of managing politics, trade, commerce and communication has revolutionized nearly every industry in Sharum Mal’Kari and guaranteed that the Kingdom of Vere remains at the center of the world stage.

## Geography
The Kingdom of Vere occupies a significant expanse of what was formerly the northern reaches of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire. These lands have been tainted by The [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]], and [[7. Scholarly Details/Ailments & Injuries/Corruption\|Corruption]] runs rampant in the south-west, darkening and destroying a great deal of their grain production and stables. Veretian territory is associated with rolling hills, plains and farmlands with pockets of temperate forests in between their thickly walled cities. Their mountains have deep stone quarries, but have little in the way of gemstones or precious metals.

## Appearance
If you encounter someone who is covered from chin to toe in embroidery and held in their clothes by more intricate lacework than could ever be practical, chances are they are Veretian. Vere is the home of corsetry and tapestries, and is a land of refined artistry. They are associated with complex detail work in all that they do, from their style of dress to their political dealings. They are graceful, elegant, and often wear their art on their sleeve— but never their heart.

It is a status symbol for a Veretian slave to be practically dripping with their owner’s jewels, decked out in all of the decadence and opulence their master can afford. These slaves tend to be dressed in jewel tones and sparkling paints, though the most expensive slaves are often dressed in sheer white and embellished with diamonds and gold. Slaves are often adorned with body chains, anklets, collars and cuffs. Most Veretians would assume anyone wearing a lot of jewelry or sparkling clothing to be either a prostitute or someone’s slave.

The royal colors are navy blue and gold, and the royal insignia is a golden starburst. Only the king and his royal attendants have permission to wear this symbol on their clothing. Amongst the public, shades of blue and gold are especially popular, and red is rarely worn since it is the color of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] royal family. Purple used to be the favored color of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire, signifying the union between the two royal houses, but it is much less popular in Vere nowadays; support for [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]] is usually indicated with an indigo hue instead.

The longest-lasting impact of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire on Veretian fashion has been the introduction of sashes and capes. Veretians have also loosened up their expectations on how women should dress for balls and banquets. It used to be that all women were fully expected to be corseted, painted, and wearing heavy hooped gowns with high heels. Nowadays, women tend to take more of a [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] approach and sometimes exchange a corset for a strappy brassiere, their hooped skirts for something more form fitting or their high heels for sandals or flats. Sometimes women even wear pants to a ball, which would have been completely unheard of a few decades ago.

## Military & Diplomacy
Veretian courts are famous for their political games and overt extravagance; most Veretians are actively involved in either the courts or the battlefield, if not both at the same time. When the [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] weakened the crumbling [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire, Vere saw an opportunity to reclaim their independence. While both the kingdoms of the former [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire have been striving to reinforce their cultural differences, they are still heavily influenced by one another and will never truly return to how they were before.

Veretian soldiers see themselves as agents of light and order fighting against the world’s darkness and chaos-- much of which they blame [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]] for. Particularly in Strathmore, there is a sense that this could be their second chance at a golden age and a reclamation of the glory and global significance they once had. Underneath the arrogance lies a much deeper desperate need to prove themselves, which often makes itself more known than Veretians would like.

Veretian Royal Knights are among the most disciplined soldiers in the world, and though they are few in number they are an extremely formidable force. Some call them “shooting stars”, for their destructive speed, their impressive and dramatic formations... and their tendency to live fairly short but glorious lives. They are easily recognizable by their flashes of gold inlaid in their armor.

## Magic & Faith
As a land often associated with clerics and champions, Vere generally prefers [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|Reiki]] over [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]] or [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]]. As a rule, Vere tends to be more defensive-minded than offensive, and has developed some rather sophisticated anti-magic systems to keep their cities (and courts) free from magical tampering. This is in no small part born from a wariness towards both [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Gath\|Gath]] and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahram]], who are each seen as magical superpowers in their own right and have historically had tensions with Veretian leadership… tensions, which in the current political climate, could easily boil over into open war.

Unsurprisingly, Vere’s favored god is [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]]. Churches and shrines for [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Sunan\|Sunan]] have been erected all over the Veretian countryside, with at least one in every town and usually at least a handful sprinkled in between on the roadways. Vere also has a quieter relationship with [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Raizin\|Raizin]], often choosing to worship them in secret.

## Education & Technology
While literacy rates are quite high in Veretian cities, in most parts of the Kingdom of Vere it is more common to pursue an apprenticeship than a formal education. Excellence in a [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Craft/Craft\|Craft]] or skill is a great source of pride in Veretian society, so apprenticeships start young and often are extremely competitive. Like much else in Vere, success generally comes down to connections and knowing the right influential people.

Part of this emphasis on apprenticeship is due to the rise of guilds, all of whom are based out of Veruna in southern Vere.  The success of the guild system has been something of a pleasant surprise for the Veretian royal family, and something they intend to capitalize on for as long as it remains viable. Since crafting and trading guilds have appeared to be the most stable and profitable, there have been a lot of incentives to train more Veretians for work in these guilds to help them grow.

## Family Life
Jewelry is often a very insulting gift, akin to a suggestion that you wish to purchase the individual. Instead, fresh flowers are a popular accessory and a cherished gift. Veretians often use a language of flowers to communicate their affections, so a knowledge of flowers is essential to Veretian courtship.

There are few greater sources of shame for a Veretian than an illegitimate child, since heredity is an important factor in determining wealth and status. Casual homosexual relationships are common, especially amongst the nobility who wish to keep their bloodlines pure, and are often seen as an appropriate way to satisfy one’s sexual urges. Homosexual partnerships, on the other hand, are uncommon; given the social and economic importance of carrying on one’s lineage and the taboo of parenting a child out of wedlock, they are generally viewed as the death of a bloodline. As a result, same-sex relationships in Vere are expected and accepted, but never as anything serious. 

Also due to the emphasis on heredity, arranged marriages are extremely common in Vere, especially for firstborn children. Extra-marital relations are rarely acknowledged but quietly accepted, provided no children result from them.

## Naming Conventions
