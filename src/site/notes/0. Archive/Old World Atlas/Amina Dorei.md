## Overview
Amina Dorei is the only region in the world that is almost entirely ethnically homogeneous (and has been for many generations). They have a reputation for being reclusive, backwards and headstrong. They have earned this through generations of isolation, restricted trade, and self-sufficiency. They are an incredibly impoverished and resource-scarce nation. Their mountains are rich with [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]]  deposits, but they lack the technology necessary to refine it. Most Doreians are taught their nation’s history from a young age, and often grow up to become extremely nationalist and xenophobic. Doreians worship [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]] and the [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|The Primordial Spirits]]. They hate and distrust all outsiders— especially [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Czyznic]]s, whom they were formerly enslaved by.

## Geography
The lands of Amina Dorei are mostly temperate forests, with massive mountain ranges to both the east and west creating a natural barrier to almost all but the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Czyznic]]s. For most of Sharum Mal’Kari’s history these woods and the lands beneath them were left largely untouched and unchanged, for it has always been the Doreian belief that the world was already made perfectly by their Maker, and any attempts to “improve” it only insults them and brings down their wrath. 

When [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Czyznic]]s occupied Amina Dorei, they tore up large swaths of these pristine woods, dug deep into the virgin mountains and made a tremendous profit off of what they found there. After the Doreian Rebellion ended [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Czyznic]] rule, the mines were ordered to be closed and the trees replanted, which is exactly what happened...in most places. 

High up in the Rodisi Mountains are the Cai Suci, a natural spring that is believed to have healing properties and grant its bathers a youthful glow. The central valley pools into Lake Danau, which is famous for its fishing and wildlife. South of Lake Danau is Tangkal, a dark, foreboding forest that is primarily occupied by Amina Dorei’s lower class. There, it is quite common to encounter toxic spiders or wasps that sting you to sleep. When a person is believed to have been corrupted, they are exiled to life (or die) in Tangkal.

## Appearance
It is almost impossible for a true Doreian to look anything less than full elf. Doreian elves in particular have either brown or red hair and dress in a tribal style with thick braids and overlapping textiles. Green eyes are rare amongst Doreians and thought of as quite beautiful, and red hair is associated with royalty. 

Tribal leaders braid their hair and it is incredibly shameful for a leader to cut their braid, though cutting or shaving other hair is acceptable. Doreians almost never have facial hair, as beards are associated with [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Czyznic]]s. Doreian hunters and soldiers often weave feathers and ribbons into their hair, and royalty usually have golden bands in their braids. 

Formal ceremonial garments are woven with unique patterns that depict a person’s tribe. Depending on the tribe, certain colors may be forbidden to be worn by commoners. No matter the tribe, purple is always forbidden, since it is impossible to achieve that hue with local dyes and therefore is seen as an outsider color that is only worn by traitors. 

A person’s body paint and tattoos are a display of honor and power, so the arms, legs and midriff are often left exposed to show these off. Doreian commoners dress in a mix of furs, woven textiles and natural materials, while the social elite tend to incorporate beading, metalwork and medallions to show their status. Seed beads are more common, but expensive clothing is adorned with imported pearl, gemstone and shell beads. 

## Military & Diplomacy
Amina Dorei is strictly an elven nation. Non-elves are usually turned away at the border towns, and invaders are pursued and attacked ruthlessly by Doreian scouts. Rarely, a foreigner may be taken to Sirene as a prisoner or a slave. These individuals are not considered to be part of Doreian society and true Doreians are trained to treat them as though they are invisible. In most cases, these invisible prisoners are from [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Oyczyzna Podgora\|Oyczyzna Podgora]].

Amina Dorei is extremely reclusive and makes great efforts to remain cut off from the rest of the world. Historically, it has been extremely rare for a Dorein to leave (or for a non-Dorein to enter). However, Mansa Markasih has interpreted [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] as the [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|Guardian Spirits]] decaying, and has decided to send some of his most trusted tribesmen out into the world to help revive the Spirits and restore their blessing. 

## Magic & Faith
There are six [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|guardian spirits]] that Doreians recognize: 

- Langit, The [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sky\|Sky]]
- Bentang, The [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Stars\|Stars]]
- Sagara, The [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Ocean\|Ocean]]
- Bumi, The [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Earth\|Earth]]
- Panonpoe, The [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sun\|Sun]]
- Bulan, The [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Moon\|Moon]]

Each [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|guardian spirit]] has a tribe dedicated to them. In the past, the royal family was often associated with the Bumi tribe, but this caused a great deal of political infighting. Nowadays, the royal family is required to forsake all connections to any one tribe and instead dedicate themselves only to [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]]. Many Sirenese citizens also make this choice.

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|Reiki]] is the preferred magic of tribal elders and royalty. Its practice has been subtly woven into everyday life in Amina Dorei, though there aren’t many who specialize in its use. All of Amina Dorei worships [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]] to at least some degree. In the capital, it is much more common to not have any specific tribal affiliation and to be much more explicitly religious. Citizens of Sirene are expected to pay homage to [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]] in the form of daily worship.

[[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] is the most sacred, and usually only tribal leaders are allowed to cast somatic rituals. Doreians see [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] as part of the natural balance of all things, and while sometimes it is necessary to use, it is important to always pay respects to the Maker and repay all that is taken— no more, no less. In this way, [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|Soma]] is sometimes treated as a special form of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Reiki\|Reiki]].

## Education & Technology
Education in Amina Dorei focuses history and spiritual practice. All Doreians are taught from a young age about the importance of the [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|guardian spirits]] and the proper ways to honor them so that they may continue to live in their blessing. They are also taught about their history as a formerly enslaved people and instructed to never trust outsiders— for they are ignorant, backwards and stubbornly oppose all that Doreians know to be true about this world, and would bring ruin to us all if given the chance. [[7. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] is proof of this.

Doreian technological advancements have been mostly around hunting and medicine, as well as developing more efficient methods of purifying food and water, constructing buildings and crafting ammunition. Amina Dorei is a resource-scarce nation, so their production of goods is in small supply but of extremely high quality— a Doreian craftsman who wastes supplies on imperfection is a craftsman who will soon find themselves out of work. 

## Family Life
Amina Dorei has six tribes, which are each associated with a different [[_. GM Screen/!Scratch Notes/Construction Zone/WIP Entities/The Primordial Spirits\|Primal Spirit]] and have different specialties. 

Dorein courtship usually involves the blessing of the whole tribe and is often pre-arranged. When two individuals with last names are married, they usually adopt a new last name chosen by their tribe.

## Naming Conventions
As far as names go, Doreians only use personal names, with the exception of royalty and some of the higher class families. In some cases a Doreian who has been outcast may choose to adopt a new family name, but more often than not they keep their name the same, as a show of national pride and loyalty.

Doreian names are unisex, and inspired by Sudanese names. Family names are inspired by Zambian names. 

Personal names: Sumantri, Petruk, Ganjar, Harja, Sasmita, Suteja, Sura, Amar, Markasih, Makili, Jayanti, Ira, Dasimah, Rusita, Kartika, Endah, Yuyu, Meida, Dahlia, Lia, Koswara, Galih, Setaji. 

Family names: Kapasule (to break up), Chilekeni (leave it alone), Epulani (to cut hair), Mphatso (gift), Chithuzi (shadow), Fwaninge (continue to die), Kondanani (love each other), Chakumanda (of the grave), Tamandani (exalted), Pemphero (prayer),  Fiskani (tell the truth), Bwerani (come back), Jata (celestial star),  Kinaya (independence), Mahiri (skillful and clever).

The current royal family name is Alinafe (Guardians are with us).
