## Overview
Czyznics are the best craftsmen and worst negotiators in the world, for they are entirely too stubborn for their own good and never forget a grudge— or a favor. They are best known for their mastery of [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] refinement and their system of [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Magic Licenses\|Magic Licenses]], both of which have become much more popular since The [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]]. Oyczyzna Podgora has already been fighting a losing battle against the [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]] for many more generations than the surface world...but are reluctant to share their experience with a world that they feel has turned their backs on them. There is a renewed sense of pride and nationalism that has come out of these dark times, especially now that their attitudes towards arcane magic appears to have been justified.

## Geography
Ancient Oyczyzna Podgora, also known as Gleboka Droga or “The Deep Roads”, used to stretch deep under the mountains of western Sharum Mal’Kari, cutting nearly as far as modern-day [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Varenveil\|Varenveil]] and [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithran]]. Since then, significant portions of these tunnels and underground settlements have either collapsed or been taken over— either by [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Wyrmkin/Dragon\|Dragon]] or by [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Darkspawn/Darkspawn\|Darkspawn]].

The crown jewel of Oyczyzna Podgora is Czystych, the Bastion of the Pure. The Bastion is an incredibly rich [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] node far beneath the Deep Roads, in the Uncharted Abyss. On its floor lies the Buried Sea. The area is a mostly derelict mine, though memories speak of an “unknown disaster” that led to its abandonment long before the The Great War. The Buried Sea has a subtle but eerie blue color, and has reportedly large waves and it is thus dangerous to observe too closely. Many Czyznics dream of being the ones to reopen Czystych, and jokingly remark that anyone who could achieve such a feat would be the richest merchant in all the world if they could exploit the untapped [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] —  however, such venture is unrealistic considering the extreme dangers involved.

## Appearance
Czyznics are stubborn, down-to-earth people who have never once thought that there could be too many belts on an outfit. They are proud, hearty mountain dwellers and their preferred style of dress reflects it: more often than not, a Czyznic is coated in a layer of soot or dust, so they commonly protect their garments with armor and cloaks.

Most commoners wear black and other dark hues, while those that can wear pale colors and keep them clean are viewed in high regard (for clearly they haven’t needed to get their elbows dirty). Czyznic cities are mostly underground and regularly stay at least 10 degrees colder than the surface temperature; furs and quilted cotton layers are popular choices. Outer layers are usually secured with a number of belts and buckles, to protect the skin from irritating dust and grime.

Very wealthy Czyznics may have [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] buttons or buckles, which appear opalescent in most lighting and faintly glow in the dark.

## Military & Diplomacy
Oyczyzna Podgora recently engaged in a successful military campaign alongside their former rivals, [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithran]], to conquer and claim some of the territories left vulnerable by the fracturing of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Bahram\|Bahrami]] Empire. This alliance with [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithran]] is a fragile, untested one, and remains to be seen whether it was merely a partnership of temporary convenience or a first step towards a deeper comradery. In general, Czyznics are extremely skeptical about the magic-using ways of the [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithrani]], but are also in no position to turn down an offered hand… so, for the moment, peace stands.

Until very recently, Oyczyzna Podgora was a deeply struggling nation grappling with an energy crisis and resource shortage. While the immediacy of these concerns have been relieved with their newly acquired territories, these solutions are very much temporary at best and are still of great concern to Czyznic leaders.

Czyznic diplomatic relations have always been limited and frigid in nature. Many generations ago, Czyznics were known as conquerors and warmongers and they are still working to rehabilitate that public image. Many of their diplomatic bridges have been burned, either as a result of military conquest or perceived betrayal, though in the case of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Seithran\|Seithran]] these bridges are beginning to be rebuilt.

Despite the reopening of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]], it is highly unlikely that that relationship will ever be repaired in the same way. In the past, Czyznia conquered [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]] in pursuit of the fuel reserves and rare resources that naturally occur there. It was the Doreian Revolution that caused Czyznia to close themselves to arcane magic and freeze all development of [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]]-based technology...and it was Czyznian occupation that caused [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Amina Dorei\|Amina Dorei]] to close themselves off to the outside world for more than 200 years. As far as each of these nations have come, they still regard one another with intense scrutiny and suspicion and are no closer to healing those ancient wounds than ever before.

## Magic & Faith
The [[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Cosmic Biology/Sundering\|Sundering]] has justified the traditional Czyznic attitudes towards [[8. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Mana\|Mana]]. They have made their vetting process more strict, and cracked down on tracking and punishing mages practicing without a [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Legislation/Magic Licenses\|license]]. Divine magic is mostly limited to select clerics who bless and watch over the forges, especially those of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Harun\|Harun]] and [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]]. They are particularly fond of the goddess [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Shaima\|Shaima]], whom they refer to as “The Maker”, and see themselves as being crafted by her hand and in her image. They also admire [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Harun\|Harun]], whom they invoke for favorable trade and safe travels through the mountains and roads. All shrines in Czyznia are required to be constructed above ground and away from the general public, out of safety concerns.

## Education & Technology
[[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] refinement is the biggest industry in Oyczyzna Podgora, and much of their machinery uses it to some degree. In fact, Czyznics used to have so much [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]]  that they used it in everyday items, like lanterns and pickaxes. Recent economic success has bolstered efforts to reopen old mines, with many Czyznics striving to reclaim their former glory.

Oyczyzna Podgora remains the only place in the world that can process and produce [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] runes and [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Lyrium\|Lyrium]]-etched weaponry. Czyznic restrictions on the use of magic and magical items limits this production tremendously, but some forges still occasionally make specialty items as commission for high-paying clients. Still, [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]] in Czyznia is more likely to be used as fuel or used in tools rather than in weaponry or armor. Back when Czyznia had an abundance of [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Dragonstone\|Dragonstone]], they developed a great deal of machinery to support their communities that depended on its usage to function, and have been struggling to develop a replacement.

Czyznic education is extremely nationalistic, often with only locally-written texts used in the curriculum. Due to limited sources of light in some communities, it is common for Czyznic texts to be written in Goron (braille), and all Czyznics are taught to read Goron as well as Czyznic and Common. Other than language, Czyznics are usually taught history and science, often with an emphasis on masonry and fungiculture. A surprising number of druids come from Czyznia, and are often among the only individuals in Goron society that are given permission to cast spells; all healing in Oyczyzna Podgora is performed either by medical professionals or by trained druids.

## Family Life
Oyczyzna Podgora is a very community-driven region, characterized by large families and even larger neighborhoods. Czyznics are known to have large communal suppers and rowdy feasts. Czyznia is famous for the acoustics of their performance spaces, and are recognized by [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Rioja\|Riojan]]s as the birthplace of jazz and blues music. 

Though a Czyznian will likely [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime Activities/Craft/Craft\|Craft]] countless objects over the course of their lifetime, most will pale in comparison to the masterwork they are expected to create for their proposal. In traditional Czyznian society, it is customary for a man to propose to his intended partner with an item he has made himself, from materials he has gathered himself. This object then is subject to scrutiny from his intended wife’s entire family, as a representative of his skill and proof of his capability to provide for his future family— and should the offering be deemed worthy, the father of the bride will give his blessing.

This tradition has shifted somewhat over time, with women sometimes playing a more active role in the process or even subverting expectations and doing the proposal themselves, but it remains the expected norm. Non-heteronormative relationships are unusual in Czyznian society, but have gradually become more accepted (though the couple are still almost always expected to maintain heterosexual gender roles within their relationship, with one partner expected to take the role of the “husband” and the other partner expected to take the role of the “wife”).
