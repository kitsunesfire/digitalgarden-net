## Overview
Somewhere deep within the Eastern Mountains, behind some mystic waterfall or underneath the rippling of a serene river, lies the entrance to secret community of elite healers known as Ihtar. Often described as a Mal'Karian paradise, Ihtar only makes itself known to those who have been chosen by the Circle of Fayte. Nobody knows how many people are part of the Circle, only that they have taken a vow to serve those most in need of saving. 

Ihtari healers are the only ones capable of curing [[8. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Materials/Lyrium\|Lyrium]] poisoning, and have had some minor success in reducing (but not eliminating) [[8. Scholarly Details/Medical/Conditions/Corruption\|Corruption]]. The Ihtari are also powerful diviners, and may be the only mortals capable of long distance teleportation. Some of their powers are believed to be connected to the teachings of an [[Empyrean\|empyrean]] who may have been a partner of [[8. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Ihtizaz\|Ihtizaz]] many centuries ago. Some scholars claim that mythic creatures such as unicorns and phoenixes live in Ihtar, but Ihtari mages wipe the memories of all who visit their lands, so none can say for sure.

It is known that Ihtari healers are a neutral force in matters of politics and war and cannot be counted on to sway the turn of battle. However, it is also believed that warriors who fight bravely for their ideals— whatever those ideals may be— may find themselves on death’s door only to awaken here instead of their fated afterlife. The conditions for qualifying for this second chance at life are a matter of great debate, but many soldiers who receive this blessing choose to repay it by renouncing their former lives and instead serving the Circle, protecting their people and their sacred work from all who wish to steal their secrets.
