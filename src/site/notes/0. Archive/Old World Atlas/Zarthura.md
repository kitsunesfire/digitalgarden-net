## Geography
Zarthura is often described as a place where everything can kill you— and most are actively trying to. Famously inhospitable, Zarthura is home to more varieties of poisonous and corrupted creatures than anywhere else in the world.

In the northeast, there’s a massive prison complex known as [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]]. A hold for the most dangerous and unforgivable criminals in all of Sharum Mal’kari, if the securities built in to [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]] don’t kill you then the surrounding landscape is bound to. However, if by some miracle an individual proves to be strong enough and clever enough to endure and outsmart all of [[4. Gazetteer/Red Wastes/Oblivion/Oblivion\|Oblivion]] and escape to Zarthura proper, they are granted full Zarthurian citizenship and the right to start a new life under a new identity.

In the southwest, [[4. Gazetteer/Mystic Mire/Surrse Kasteel/Surrse Kasteel\|Surrse Kasteel]] marks the beginnings of Val’Drah’s true domain. It is this boiling, acid-marred landscape that she has called home for centuries, and somewhere in the center of it all rests the keep she rules the nation from. Though there are many depictions of the Black Keep in Zarthurian art and poetry, only her Children have had the privilege of seeing the structure firsthand. According to legend, her power over domain is so great that she can disintegrate entire intruding armies without needing to leave the comfort of her throne. This strength has not been tested, or questioned, in public memory.
