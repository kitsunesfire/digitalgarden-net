# Leisure

[[0. Archive/Leisure/Leisure\|Leisure]] is short-term version of [[2. Rules Reference/Downtime/Downtime\|Downtime]] that may happen when your party either stops to take a rest or otherwise takes a temporary break during their [[2. Rules Reference/Exploration/Exploration\|Exploration]]. In most cases, [[0. Archive/Leisure/Leisure\|Leisure]] can only take place in a secured location, such as a roadhouse, hotel, campsite, or base of operations. 

### Camping

When camping in the wilderness, once you finish preparing a campsite, you will usually simply head to bed immediately-- automatically consuming rations and [[7. Common Knowledge/Travel/Resting/Resting\|Resting]] to end your adventuring day. However, your GM may decide to occasionally allow for some extra time to be spent at camp where you may attempt number of different [[0. Archive/Leisure/Leisure Activities\|Leisure Activities]]. These activities can help bolster your team's exploration efforts, build bonds between your teammates, or allow time for special interests involving the wild outdoors.
