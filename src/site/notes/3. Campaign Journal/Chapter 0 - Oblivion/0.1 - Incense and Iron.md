# FLASH FORWARD SEQUENCE: DAY ?

We’re already in trouble

[[8. Scholarly Details/Metaphysics/Spiritual Alchemy/Aeon\|Aeon]]’s are with us

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]] brings us to a large room with a large table. One man sits at the end  
Black set of leather armor, silver gauntlets, sharp silver eyes that watch us. Black bird perched on throne

  

Everything started when the “Registry” was announced  
- Thats when she knew for sure that we were there

- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]] mentions: [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Raziel\|Raziel]] is the only person she believes can accomplish something like this  
  
[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Raziel\|Raziel]]: experiment man, he’s in charge of what we went through.  
Studied up and perfected.

  

# FLASHBACK SEQUENCE: DAY 1

Experiment:

20 at first, only us left

A crystal was part of this experiment, it was “already full”

Coffin, smoke, chanting, [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Raziel\|Raziel]]’s voice, his chanting was guiding, said: *missed

General vibe: [[_. GM Screen/SECRETS/Daemon\|Daemon]]ic cult bad juju, something about pain offering blood

Second voice pierces through:

*Kasey made fun queue cards to make life easier, thank you Kacey!!

Nigredo

- “ The road ahead comes with pain. Take it only when you have enough blood to affect it.
    

Albedo

- Dreams make for good stories, but everything important happens when we are awake, for that is when we make things happen.
    

Citrinas

-  Real loss only occurs when you love something else more than yourself
    

Rubedo

- You must be willing to kill the person you were born to be to become the person you were meant to be.
    

  

Cute Rogue Celestine Guy: Writing down notes

Pretty Heterochromia Woman Celestine: Inspecting Pillar

Hot but Evil Priest: Casually walks up and is not concerned with our results

  

They’re throwing us into a fight after events in the pod.

We’re allowed to bring any of our items in with us:

- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Rogue girl (who lost an arm)]] takes everything
    
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Jair\|Silver man]] takes a med kit
    
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Hideaki\|Hideaki]] takes his orb, and a book
    
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Marlow\|I]] take my Rapier and Dueling cape
    

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Jair\|Silver haired boy]] uses snow magic, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Hideaki\|Hide]] uses grease and [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|girl with one arm]] stabs it to death.

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Marlow\|Marlow]] did a sick flip dolphin dive attack.

  

We won!!!! Roar of applause!

  

We give back our stuff, they let us keep one.

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Rogue girl]] tries to sneak an item, we tag team that situation and manage to sneak something (???) past the guards.

- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Niles\|Niles]] chewing gum on the job, might have a sweet tooth.
    

We’re out! Time to celebrate! Nope, [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Hideaki\|Hide]] cuts me off with work time.

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]]’s in trouble. 

Glass eyed and dizzy. Hears voices from… up? Might be a [[Yokai\|Yokai]] thing according to [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Hideaki\|Hide]]. Might also be [[_. GM Screen/SECRETS/Daemon\|Daemon]] that's causing [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]]'s issue. Marlow brought everyone to [[_. GM Screen/SECRETS/Daemon\|Daemon]] /= [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]] 101.

  

Team goes to see [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Clementine\|Clementine]]. She gives us a lead. Someone in Oblivion might be here on purpose investigating [[_. GM Screen/SECRETS/Daemon\|Daemon]] stuff. She wants to go into the Arena. 

We’ve got connections to the Kitchen - [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Irene\|Irene]] wants [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Kelly]] to stop selling sweets and messing with her sales. [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Kelly]] begrudgingly accepts. 

  

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Hideaki\|Hide]], [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Jair\|Jair]] and [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Kelly]] go to library while I wait for sweets.

Mechanical arm guy in library = [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Sullivan\|Sullivan]], believes in the system. 

- Is surprised that we got out. 
    

He doesn't think there have ever been any quite like us. Does not believe we will be let out.

Music? Sometimes prisoners would wander aimlessly and when they would try guiding them back to their rooms, they would resist because they wanted to listen to the music, but they couldn't.

Different people react differently. This siren's song of hypnotism. 

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Kelly]] and [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Jair\|Jair]] find book on [[_. GM Screen/SECRETS/Daemon\|Daemon]]s:

Number of different ways a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demon]] seduces its victims. 

Uses of melody and song to draw them under their spell. 

Ways to defend yourself: The author suggests only the strong of heart can withstand a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demon]]'s advances. 

Likely there would be a reference to a cursed and ancient cult said to have been worshiping [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demon]]s.

  

Cookies are done! [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Niles\|Niles]] is also done (with his shift). 

Goblin guard’s there, not [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Niles\|Niles]].

Plan B: Just gave [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Clementine\|Clementine]] the cookies, she can handle it tomorrow

  

> Going to bed

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Shae\|Kelly]] has fun interaction with [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Peyton\|Peyton]].  
  

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Valentina\|Valentina]] is the best gal pal: Provides clues on people acting weird!  
- Noticed in particular, [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Rory\|Rory]], Collette and [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Mallory\|Mallory]] seem to be quieter than usual. She has not  
seen [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Ike\|Ike]] for a long time.

  
[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]]’s gonna get better I’m sure

  
Poor [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Jair\|Jair]]

# FLASHBACK SEQUENCE: DAY 2

DAY 2 START

  

Go to the arena to find [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Mallory\|Mallory]].

Managed to convince [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Niles\|Niles]] to let me in to talk to [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Mallory\|Mallory]].

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Mallory\|Mallory]]’s not doing so well

She’s hearing the voices

Asks me if I’m religious

Tell her sorta truth

> Oh she’s really not ok

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Marlow\|Marlow]] gets her to close her eyes and think of things that matter to her.

[[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Marlow\|Marlow]] used their [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Artificial/Doppelganger\|doppelganger]]’s disguise to imitate a [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Extraplanar/Seraph\|seraph]]. Used a face they believed to be seraphic, beautiful, yet ethereal and definitely not [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Human\|human]].

Manages to calm her down and bring her back hope. 

Gotta cover up my tracks - Gaslights her into thinking she was just transported into a conversation with an angel of her god.

 > Hope restored!!!!

Tell everyone she heard the voices she needed to hear and got better.

  

We move to dining hall

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Clementine\|Clementine]]!

- Big Crystal in the arena?
    
- She high
    
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Rory\|Rory]]’s the name! He’s at the gym for sure
    

  

We go to see [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Rory\|Rory]]:

- He’s difficult to reason with at first
    
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Jair\|Jair]] opens up the floor to make a deal
    
- [[5. Dramatis Personae/Core Party/Marlow\|Marlow]] manages to talk with him further in [[8. Scholarly Details/Arts & Culture/Languages/Abyssal\|Abyssal]]
    
- Tells us to meet in church. Watch out for [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Helena\|Helena]]
    
- Oh. [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Ramsey\|Ramsey]] sucks
    

  

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Rory\|Rory]] Church talk:  
- [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Devakim]]

- On the Voices:

- something very old, or something incredibly new.

- His father,when he was little, told him stories of the old world:

- Nothing in this world that he needed to be afraid of because the call of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|the Abyss]] could not reach them here. 

  

[[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|Demon]]s 102: Call of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|the Abyss]]

- This is the primary reason why [[7. Common Knowledge/Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Demon\|demon]]s make that journey, from [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/Erebus\|Erebus]] to [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. 
    
- They’re fleeing the call of [[8. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Erebus/The Abyss\|the abyss]]. They’re fleeing that terror.
    
- It draws them in, makes them slaves to them. 
    
- Even though they’re hunted here, its at least better than being a slave. 
    
- One of the biggest dangers of living in the human world is that you forget yourself.
    
- Figure out what made her listen in the first
    
- We need to listen to something else, we need to hear something else. 
    

  

Lets save [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]]!

  

Back to Dorm:

- Team manages to talk to [[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]].
    
- She misses her old land
    
- Her lord believes in her
    
- Someone took something from her
    
- An orb
    

- An orb was stolen, the “emperor” is trying to use it to open the ruins
    

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]] is back!

  

NEW PLAN:

We gotta bounce: 

She tells us that [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]]'s technology has advanced way beyond expectations. 

[[5. Dramatis Personae/NPC Compendium/Prologue/Maeve\|Maeve]] came here to look into this technology. She got too close.
