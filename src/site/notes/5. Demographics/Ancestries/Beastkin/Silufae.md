[Silufae](https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/ZqPSbH75-silufae)  have a well-earned reputation for their good spirits, gregarious personalities, and love of revels. Most silufae are drawn by two simple desires: to see the world, and to sample its every pleasure. While their spontaneity and whimsy sometimes puts them at odds with more stoic peoples, silufae rarely let the moodiness of others hinder their own happiness.

Silufae are not terribly concerned with the past or the future-- only the ever-exciting _now_. They believe life is for living, and rarely think ahead further than the next scrumptious morsel, tantalizing sensation, or novel excitement. At their best, these faun-folk are joyous and whimsical... but at their worst, they can be selfish and cruel. 

Most silufae simply wander wherever their whims take them, following impulses and living off the land. When they congregate, it's usually for a "revel"; revels are week-long parties that often indulge in every sense imaginable before finally settling down into the rubble. For better and worse, silufae live for freedom, happiness, and excitement.

Though, this is not to say that all silufae are _entirely_ devoted to debauchery. Some form druidic circles devoted to restoring and nurturing wildlife. Others become explorers, emissaries, and storytellers known as "Dawngreets". These adventurous silufae spread stories that expound their carefree philosophies as far as they can travel. They are just as famous for their love of tea as they are their love of wine, and are generally known to be prolific gatherers and helpful wilderness guides. 

While they typically balk at any suggestion of "authority", many groups of silufae are lead by a "sibyl". Sibyls are typically elder silufae that have been blessed with a limited foresight into the future and gifts of healing, which they use to warn their allies of dangers and protect them from those that have already come to pass.
