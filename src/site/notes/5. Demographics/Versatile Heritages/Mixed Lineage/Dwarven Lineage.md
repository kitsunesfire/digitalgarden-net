# Dwarven Lineage

In you beats the heart of the forge, and you carry the blood of blessed warriors born to craft and wield mighty weapons of war. You gain the dwarf trait, the half-dwarf trait, and [low-light vision](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=416). In addition, you can select dwarf, half-dwarf, and human feats whenever you gain an ancestry feat.
