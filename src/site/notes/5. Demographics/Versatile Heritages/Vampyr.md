# Vampyr

> [!NOTE] Note
> Vampires, or "vampyr", in Sharum Mal'kari are different from those in other settings, notably due to the disconnect from many of the classic myths associated with them. In [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], vampyr are neither truly alive nor dead.

You gain the vampyr trait. You have the negative healing ability, which means you are harmed by negative effects if you were undead. You can select from vampyr (and dhampir) feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat. You also gain the Feed ability. 

This versatile heritage, unlike most others, can be acquired by a character after 1st level. If this happens, the character replaces their original heritage with this one, and going forward cannot select feats from their prior heritage.
