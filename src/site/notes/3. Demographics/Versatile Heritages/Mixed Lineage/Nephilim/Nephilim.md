# Nephilim

[[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] are the mortal offspring that result from a union between a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] entity and a mortal being-- usually, but not always, a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Human\|human]]. A [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] typically inherits some manner of divine gifts from their [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] parent, though these powers do not always match those of their parent. As a rule, [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] are considered to be considerably weaker than a full-blooded [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] being. 

[[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] are usually highly charismatic and strikingly beautiful, taking after their celestial parent. However, for some, they might inherit some manner of physical deformity instead-- though this usually recedes by the time they reach adolescence. Only in the rarest of cases do [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] take on noticeable traits which might give away the truth of their parentage. Even when a [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] obtains such features as horns or pointed ears, they are usually small or subtle enough that they can easily hide or disguise them, if they so desire. A [[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] is most likely to manifest traits that are similar to that of their [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] parent... but this is not always a given. As such, it is perfectly possible for a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Devil\|Devil]] to parent a child with [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|Seraph]] traits, for example. Such unusual (and generally undesirable) results are commonly rejected-- or even killed-- by their [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] parent.

[[3. Demographics/Versatile Heritages/Mixed Lineage/Nephilim/Nephilim\|Nephilim]] are generally quite rare, and certainly aren't numerous enough to form a society of their own; nearly all of them either ally themselves with [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] entities or with mortals.
