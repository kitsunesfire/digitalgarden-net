# Wyldling

[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldling]] is a general term used for any [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] who does not belong to any of the courts. These "courtless" [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] are commonly considered to be insane-- and even from childhood are said to demonstrate strange behaviors, such as speaking to the air (or to something no one else can see), wandering into forbidden and sacred places, pointing out rude and uncomfortable truths, or weeping or screaming at odd moments. There is no "typical" personality for a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldling]], beyond this association with madness; they can be calm, violent, cheerful, or reserved, sometimes even all at once. The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] all have something about them that makes other [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] uneasy, though-- something strange, often abnormal. For whatever reason, this often presents as an abnormal manner of communicating, such as using odd vocabulary, talking in questions or riddles, using an irregular cadence, or sometimes not speaking at all and communicating entirely in gesture.

The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] often have great magical talent, even for [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]], though no one trains them in its use. These unique gifts often present as an unusual combination of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|Artes]], often blending abilities associated with multiple different courts. [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]] must either figure out their powers on their own, find a teacher amongst the other [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]], or-- very rarely-- forge a pact with a powerful entity. One ability common to all [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] is the capacity to see what others do not. This may mean seeing the invisible, looking into other realms, discerning the truth amidst lies, or knowing the past or the future. Other [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] sometimes seek out a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldling]] for divinations regarding future events, asking them to throw bones or read the stars. Some [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] have managed to become rather famous seers in this way, but even so, they are not accepted into [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadian]] society. 

The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] tend to either live alone or in tribes. They are reclusive and stealthy, often preferring to remain close to nature. They are rarely seen, and mostly have made their homes in the ever-shifting [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Wyldlands/Wyldlands\|Wyldlands]] in between the settled [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia/Courts of Arcadia\|Courts of Arcadia]], sometimes even traversing and claiming neighboring pockets of [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/The Fade\|The Fade]] as their own territory. 

[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldlings]] are strongly inclined towards chaos. Some philosophers say that this lawlessness is necessary to balance the structure of the courts, and to maintain the proper order of the world through an occasional leavening of disorder. The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|Wyldling]] owe no fealty to anyone, neither lord nor lady nor seasonal monarch. No one can tell them what to do or how to channel their power. Conversely, they can never hold any other rank within Arcadian society, and cannot rule in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]]. 

Overall, [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] are both revered and feared in [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Inner Planes/Arcadia/Arcadia\|Arcadia]], mostly because the laws that bind other [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] do not apply to them-- in particular, the laws regarding killing [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]]. It rarely happens, but the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Wyldling\|wyldlings]] have been known to slay a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Apparition/Fey/Fey\|Fey]] for no apparent reason. This kind of killing is considered the "Will of the Wylds", and it is not permitted to seek any kind of vengeance for this act.
