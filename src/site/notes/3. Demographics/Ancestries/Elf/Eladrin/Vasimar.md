The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have historically had a reputation for generally staying out of-- or, perhaps more accurately, being *kept* out of-- [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthurian]] politics. They are best known for their adherence to the "old ways": specifically, the ancient [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Magical Traditions/Soma\|somatic]] traditions of [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Alternative Magic/Geomancy\|Geomancy]]. They are commonly seen as healers, guardians and craftsmen, though their reluctance to adopt new [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Imperialist\|Imperialist]] technologies and policies within their territories have gradually made them into enemies of [[4. Gazetteer/Diurnan Valley/Axiom/Axiom\|Axiom]] and harmed their reputation as a result. 

It is common for [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] to have fine line tattoos, especially on their face and torso, and some [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] may have especially long ears and/or antler-like horns. [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] usually have either light green or pale blue eyes, though soft grey or light brown eyes are also fairly common. 

The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are elite craftsmen who specialize in working with exotic and esoteric materials. They are famed for their technical ability, which is said to exceed that of nearly any other faction in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]-- perhaps even the whole of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]]. Patient and deliberate in all that they do, the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are particularly famous for the quality of their work and their capacity to temper even the most delicate and volatile substances, especially where rare metals and magical products such as [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] are concerned. As a result, they have been responsible for the creation of a wide array of legendary weapons and artifacts, and have built mighty reliquaries to house these treasures. 

Until recently, [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] workshops were responsible for nearly all of the [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] production in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. Recently, however, the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]] has shifted more and more of their work to new industrial centers that are being established in other parts of [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Zarthura\|Zarthura]]. These centers are able to produce larger volumes of [[7. Scholarly Details/Specialty Items & Materials/Key Items/Materia/Materia\|Materia]] more quickly than the artisans of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are able to with their traditional methods, and employ a great number of laborers across the nation, so they are overall quite popular-- except amongst the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]], naturally, who understand that this is just the latest in a long string of efforts to remove them from national power and relevance. 

Many of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are local idol priests, who see divinity not only in the [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|Deities]] but in all things, and see a divine force at work in the universe as a whole. As a people they are taught to believe that the world itself has a sentience and sapience of its own, which they refer to as [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gaea\|Gaea]]. They deeply revere all aspects of life, death, and rebirth as a means of honoring this [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gaea\|Goddess Who Slumbers Within]]. In their work and in their worship they present themselves as "humble gardeners" who meticulously and fervently tend to the Blessed Domain of their Goddess. They believe they have been charged with maintaining her Glorious and Most Generous creations-- and been blessed with the means to do so.  

Each of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] channel the power of the universe in a different way, usually through worship of a particular idol, holy site, or local [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Local Gods\|deity]]. They do not generally believe that their [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gaea\|Goddess]] has any particular "agenda", so they most often strive for balance and moderation, both for themselves and the world around them. This attitude often led them to take the role of mediators in olden times, but nowadays it is far less common for the populace to seek the counsel of the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]], often preferring the more immediate and dramatic results that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] can provide.

Ever since it was founded, the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] have vehemently and vocally opposed the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Church of the Celestine]]. It is their belief that the ancient rituals that the [[5. Dramatis Personae/Factions/Celestine\|Celestine]] have revived should have stayed forgotten, and that their practices actively bring harm to [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Local Gods/Gaea\|Gaea]]. However, the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Eladrin/Vasimar\|Vasimar]] are seen as old-fashioned, out of touch, and increasingly irrelevant, which means that their complaints typically fall on deaf ears.
