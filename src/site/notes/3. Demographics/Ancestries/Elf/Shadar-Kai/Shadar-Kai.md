Also known as "high elves", the [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] are an ancient sub-group of [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Elf\|elves]] that have a strong [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Other Related Terms/Resonance\|Resonance]] with celestial [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Artes/Artes\|artes]] ([[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Moon\|Moon]], [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Sun\|Sun]] and [[7. Scholarly Details/Magic/Primordial Sources/Stars\|Stars]]). Overall, [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] have a reputation for being elitist, demanding, arrogant, and condescending to all other [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Ancestries\|Ancestries]]-- even towards other [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Elf\|elves]]. 

The [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] of [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]] are often associated with ancient celestial powers, particularly the sun and the moon.
They are rumored have supernatural origins, but are considered to be native to the lands currently occupied by the [[4. Gazetteer/Eternian Empire\|Eternian Empire]]. 

They are most commonly of average height with a lithe build; even exceptionally strong [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] tend to look rather slim compared to other ancestries. Their skin tones tend towards the extremes of either ivory-fair or ebony-dark, frequently with an otherworldly lavender or pearlized sheen. Most [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Elf/Shadar-Kai/Shadar-Kai\|Shadar-Kai]] have white hair, but other variances along the monochromatic spectrum are not unheard of. High elven eyes, unlike human eyes, can be found in nearly any hue imaginable, and more often than not have iridescent or metallic flecks through the iris.
