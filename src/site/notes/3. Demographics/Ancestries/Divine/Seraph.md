A [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|Seraph]] is a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Divine\|Divine]] entity whose powers are directly linked to one of the Outer Planes ([[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Elysium/Elysium\|Elysium]] or [[7. Scholarly Details/Cosmology/Outer Planes/Tartarus/Tartarus\|Tartarus]]). [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|Seraphs]] are almost always linked to a particular [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|deity]], though in some rare cases they may be connected to more than one. 

[[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|Seraphs]] have always been quite uncommon in [[0. Archive/Sharum Mal'Kari\|Sharum Mal'Kari]], but for one reason or another, they have become especially rare in the past few generations. As a result, communities who manage to attract the presence of a [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|Seraph]] (or better yet, have one born into their populace) tend to also attract a great deal of tourism and other attentions. [[3. Demographics/Ancestries/Divine/Seraph\|Seraphs]] themselves are often treated as minor celebrities, especially if they are linked to a popular [[7. Scholarly Details/Deities/Deities\|deity]].
