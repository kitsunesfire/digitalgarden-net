[Kitsune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=38) are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants them many magical abilities-- chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.

Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-eared humanoid, and one largely depending on where and how they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a "tailless form"-- a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry for that area, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.

Though some small kitsune-majority settlements do exist (primarily in [[0. Archive/Old World Atlas/Sokoku\|Sokoku]]), most prefer to live amongst people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters. 

With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality. 

Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone might need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles. 

When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to "break character", shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment. 

Due to their shifting nature, kitsune often have mixed-ancestry family units. The children of a kitsune and a non-kitsune can inherit either of their parent's lineages, though many assume that a human baby born to a kitsune is simply a kitsune that has yet to reveal their "true" form. This has led to the widespread misconception that all offspring of kitsune are, themselves, kitsune.
